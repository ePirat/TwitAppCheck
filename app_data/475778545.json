Escape the dusty city and go for a tropic ride! The ADVENTURE begins today!\n\nThe plane has crashed, and you are the sole survivor. You look around and see palm-trees basking in the tropical sun this could be a nice place to live, after all. It may take a bit of work to make it the home you deserve, but it still beats the heck out of sitting in an office!\n\nFirst you have to clear the workspace. Trees, rocks and grass make excellent building materials. Chop a little kindling to get a fire going. And you may just find something of interest beneath those moss-grown boulders or inside tree-hollows.\nComing up next is your OWN FARM. Or a botanical garden. Or, better yet, an orchard or a ranch\u2014you name it. As luck would have it, there is a whole shipment of seeds and continental animals on that plane. Different strokes for different folks. Mango and papaya ain't no fun? Why, grow cabbage aplenty! Giraffes too gaudy? You can keep a chicken or twenty and a herd of pigs. What could be better than greasy scrambled eggs-and-bacon to start a tropical morning with?\n\nNature takes its course, and predators are abundant on the island, but so long as you got brain to go with brawn, your sheep and goats will be safe. Once you build a workshop, you can work a piece of ironwood into a hefty club. Fasten a knapped quartz rock to it, and you get a hand-axe to ward off that pesky wolf. Don't stop there\u2014more adventures await!\n\nAdventures on the island are many and varied. What's in the TREASURE chest that washed up ashore? Who's on that mystical ship rocking in the waves? And is that a pirate's ghost creeping about? You can't fight apparitions with a hand-axe. That's where your friends come in!\n\nAs a Robinson, you can HIRE your Men Fridays to do menial work from all over the social network world: Facebook, Game Center and OpenFeint. You can give them gifts ranging from boas to chimpanzees to encourage them to work for their Master Robinson. Make your paradise the most prosperous and thriving enterprise of all paradises lost!\n\nRobinson is the first survival-in paradise kind of game for iPhone, from the makers of \u201cLittle Helper\u201d!
