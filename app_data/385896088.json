The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the file detail page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, but TV-out function only supported by iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nTwitter: @OLIMSOFT\nMail: olimsoft@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.edavs.com", "artistName": "olimsoft", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1098.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/c8/28/29/c828297f-153d-6597-c1eb-937b60f925ae/mzl.qvjszkkt.png", "version": "2.1.00", "primaryGenreId": 6002, "primaryGenreName": "Utilities", "fileSizeBytes": "45245718", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "OPlayerHD Lite", "genreIds": ["6002", "6011"], "trackName": "OPlayerHD Lite", "releaseNotes": "- Add flat UI for iOS8.
