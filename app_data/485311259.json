Thrown out into the snow on Christmas day, the Smelly Sprout comes up against a terribly rude Christmas tree, an awfully impolite snowman and, worst of all, a greedy fox. \n\nBut will a chance encounter with someone as small as the sprout change everything?\n\nWith deliciously witty illustrations and a story to touch the heart, this charming tale is loved by children and parents alike.\n\n---------------------------------\nFEATURES\n---------------------------------\n* TOUCHING story.\n* WITTY illustrations.\n* SLY humour.\n* DISCOVER secret sounds and events.\n* ENJOY a full narration by the author or read the book yourself.\n* AUTOPLAY for young children and anybody who just wants to sit back and enjoy the story.\n\n**********\n\"For an offbeat seasonal story, beautifully drawn and full of sly humour, The Smelly Sprout by Allan Plenderleith is warmly recommended. It is a charming picture book about a neurotic, self-centred sprout that simply can't understand why nobody likes it.\" - Max Davidson, The Telegraph UK\n**********\n\nFrom the makers of top rated books: Tickle Finger in the Jungle, Tickle Finger Under the Sea, Princess Chocolate and The Boy Giant.\n\nAlso a published book and a best seller!\n\nGuaranteed to be a favourite this Christmas with children everywhere, whether or not they like sprouts!", "artistName": "Jason Stewart", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1159.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/91/35/90/9135909e-9784-7b33-bb2a-5a55630292d0/mzl.kghiovst.png", "version": "2.3", "primaryGenreId": 6018, "primaryGenreName": "Book", "fileSizeBytes": "34984684", "price": 1.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "The Smelly Sprout", "genreIds": ["6018"], "trackName": "The Smelly Sprout", "releaseNotes": "Bug fixes.", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/51/1c/e1/511ce123-c1e9-64d4-ea63-4c53e1425677/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/c0/48/9d/c0489d73-e99a-4d30-4a79-5646813f0da6/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ad/ec/5d/adec5ddc-dc86-5479-6152-df77c13c81ea/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/74/d8/09/74d809ca-23f2-6240-bd49-1be53c9f2392/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/04/c8/44/04c84420-0254-b53a-6e76-c7eaba462b81/screen320x320.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 270, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "$1.99", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jason-stewart/id922008272?uo=4", "kind": "software", "sellerName": "Jason Stewart", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPad23G", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPadMini", "iPad3G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone4", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone-3GS", "iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5s", "iPadWifi", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadFourthGen", "iPhone5c"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1159.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/91/35/90/9135909e-9784-7b33-bb2a-5a55630292d0/mzl.kghiovst.png", "bundleId": "com.outfit7.wotsamaflip.smellysprout", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-smelly-sprout/id485311259?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a908.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/af/ee/ae/afeeaebe-9545-9210-dd99-55f5d61cde21/Icon-57.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
