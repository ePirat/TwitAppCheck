Now getting together with friends for a drink, movie or just to hangout is a snap!\n\nSee what all your friends are doing and where they are without ever opening up Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare or even your phone contacts.  You\u2019ll see the last location each of your friends checked in at and all the posts they made on their different social media profiles.  There\u2019s no need to jump between five different apps just to see what all your friends are doing; your friends\u2019 locations and their activities are all in a single spot with Connect. More than just a friend finder, Connect is about expanding and developing your existing relationships.  The activities tab shows you what your friends are doing when they check in their location.  No videos you don\u2019t want to watch and no links to articles you don\u2019t want to read.  If you\u2019re in the mood for hitting that popular restaurant at happy hour, simply open up Connect, see who\u2019s already there from all your social networks and drop them a message to save you a seat.
