It\u2019s here! The app has been adapted for the screens of iPhone 6, 6 plus, Full HD, IMAX, rear-view mirrors, baby prams and tamagotchis! We know that we should have launched it before, but our favourite unicorn has caused some unexpected problems and we had to provide him some reassurance and support.\n\nThe good news keep coming! We have fixed a bug, yep, the one who didn\u2019t allow us to enter the app through Facebook in some cases. As a punishment, we tied our developer to a table leg, thinking he was going to go crazy, but he didn't, so we have to think about something else.\n\nOn the other hand, we have added again the image of the product on the list of conversations ( yep, we read your 437 emails and your 302 reviews that you sent us) and you can also edit the currency. Also we have fixed more bugs such as the deleting of conversations/notifications, the screen to report users, the text scrolls\u2026.\n\nAfter doing the same error, again and again, we did it! The camera of the iPad \u2026 IS WORKING! We have given a bag of M&M\u2019s to the culprit, and when he was happy and almost enjoying it, we have taken it away from him. Sometimes we have to take hard decisions.\n\nLast but not least, the entrails of the app have been improved. It\u2019s something that you can\u2019t see, but you can feel. And believe us, you want it to work.\n\nThanks a lot for all your suggestions. We are working really hard to make from Wallapop a better app everyday.
