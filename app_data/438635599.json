You can even say commands while audio is playing, thanks to vokul's acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) technology.\n\nWith vokul, button presses and distracted screen glances are a thing of the past!\n\n\nExamples (while audio is playing):\n\n\u201cvokul forward 30\u201d : skips forward 30 seconds\n\n\u201cvokul back\u201d : skips backward 15 seconds (configurable)\n\n\u201cvokul pause\u201d : pauses playback\n\n\u201cvokul play podcasts\u201d : starts playing podcasts; the most recent episode is played first\n\n\nvokul works on iOS devices including the iPhone 3GS and later models, iPod touch 3G and later models (iPod touch 3G requires an external mic), and all iPad models. Supported freeform dictation languages include English and Spanish (Europa, Mexican, and U.S.).\n\nCheck out www.vokulnation.com for more information and videos showing vokul in action.\n\n* Bluetooth operation is great for messaging; A2DP mode for music playback is NOT supported, due to iOS limitations.\n\nNote: vokul currently does not support reading received text messages, due to limitations imposed by iOS.\n\nNote: Starting with iOS 6, you must press 'send' to send a text message or email. This is due to iOS restrictions.", "artistName": "KulTek, LLC", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1035.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/52/a4/e3/52a4e3b7-d038-70a5-ba9c-de871bba95ec/mzl.irkofmql.png", "version": "1.2.11", "primaryGenreId": 6007, "primaryGenreName": "Productivity", "fileSizeBytes": "88011711", "price": 2.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "vokul", "genreIds": ["6007", "6011"], "trackName": "vokul", "releaseNotes": "Fixed a bug which caused the app to crash when using Bluetooth under iOS 7.1.", "sellerUrl": "http://www.vokulnation.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ce/60/a3/ce60a353-dfbe-6ebd-78f7-aade317ce7f9/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/2e/d3/20/2ed3204c-3968-4d8f-a908-26ee499f8766/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/76/3f/89/763f896d-c9e5-b17b-a1e6-a2b357e43f89/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/fb/3a/6a/fb3a6a34-83b5-2c9d-a081-846e092250cc/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/a1/71/79/a1717982-8d30-c4ad-0d05-a9e7b73de239/screen322x572.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 100, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "$2.99", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/kultek-llc/id438635602?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 3.5, "sellerName": "KulTek, LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5", "iPadMini", "iPadWifi", "iPhone-3GS", "iPadMini4G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5c", "iPhone4S", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPad2Wifi", "iPad3G", "iPhone5s", "iPhone4", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadThirdGen4G"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1035.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/52/a4/e3/52a4e3b7-d038-70a5-ba9c-de871bba95ec/mzl.irkofmql.png", "bundleId": "com.kultek.vokul", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vokul/id438635599?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1196.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/5d/15/dd/5d15dd52-7a5c-b03e-44b6-ba30b24ebd7d/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
