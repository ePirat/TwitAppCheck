Hall is now my company\u2019s go-to for business messaging. We\u2019re really impressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing user experience! Secure, fast, and easy-to-use. It\u2019s everything my company has been looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried using Yammer, Podio, and Slack but found their interfaces to be unfriendly. We are an engineering team, but we still communicate with non-engineers who need a user-friendly business messenger. Hall was a great solution for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy agency relies heavily on Dropbox and Box. With Hall\u2019s new integrations, we now share files from Dropbox and Box to our clients in real-time. We are happy. And so are our clients.\u201d\n\u201cCoTap, GroupMe, and Podio lack web and desktop apps. But Hall works across all platforms like iMessage, which makes much more sense for business purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProductivity and collaboration have soared at our company since using Hall. People needed an outlet for their ideas, information, and concerns - now we have that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that I can connect with coworkers AND clients outside my company. I can do all my communication in one place. I hardly use email anymore, which saves me tons of time.\u201d\n\nHow Hall Helps Teams Work Better:\n\n* Communicate with coworkers, customers, and clients all day, everyday\n\n* Eliminate email to save time and energy and avoid spam and phishing\n\n* Share links, files, and information quickly so all team members are up-to-date\n\n* Receive business messages wherever you are\n\n* Brainstorm and collaborate with teams near or far\n\n* Stay in-the-know of everything happening at work\n\n* Communicate freely with your team in a collaborative atmosphere\n\n* Access all your files, information, and contacts on any device\n\nExtra Features on Desktop:\n\n* Integrations: Trello, Asana, JIRA, Github, New Relic, Bitbucket, Heroku, Hubot, Jenkins, New Relic, Pivotal Tracker, UserVoice, Crashlytics, Zapier, Zendesk, Exceptional, and Get Satisfaction\n\n\nContact Us:\n\nWe love hearing from you!
