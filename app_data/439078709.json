Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying: \n\n\u201cWe combined her date of sunset drinks at a beachfront alehouse with my idea of running into the ocean at night. Since then our jeans have dried, our feet have thawed, and we\u2019ve seen lots more of each other.\u201d - Rob, 29, Venice, CA\n\n\u201cAaron's date idea was to go to a driving range, and I had the perfect place... He even managed to sneak in a kiss! Nine months later we are still together and happy as ever, thanks to HowAboutWe! - Sammie, 22, Washington DC\n\n\u201cMarcie and I immediately hit it off. On our first date we went for Italian in Chelsea... we've been a couple since and each day is better than the last.
