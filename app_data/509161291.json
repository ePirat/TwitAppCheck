With AppMe you have a great \"Instant Messenger\" at your disposal to exchange messages live with your friends \u2013 whether in private or as a group chat. It works just as fast and easily as a text message, but without the extra costs.\n\nFriend Network\n===========\nYour AppMe friends will automatically be added from your mobile phone's address book. Unlike the traditional \"social networks\" (such as Facebook), they will be much more closely and privately linked to you: quality instead of quantity! With your own wall for status updates and comments, you can share your thoughts and ideas with your friends and stay up to date.\n\nApp CheckIns\n=========\nShow your friends which apps you like and use. Keep tabs on which hot apps your friends are using. With the \"App CheckIn\" function, your favorite apps will show up on your personal wall. Your friends can install these apps themselves right from your wall with just a few clicks.\n\n... and a whole lot more\n================\nThere are a lot more functions to discover that you soon won't want to do without.\n\n+ Text display in the chat while you type: a brand-new live chat experience which is a lot faster and more fun than anywhere else.\n\n+ Friend map with integrated route display: this is where your friends are right now. This feature can, of course, be deactivated in your privacy settings.\n\n+ Received and read status for each message: no more worrying about whether or not your message got through.\n\nFree \u2013 no hidden costs\n===============\nAppMe can be installed and used absolutely free. You only have the normal costs for mobile data transfer, which are usually covered by a flat rate. Of course, fast WLAN access is also possible. With AppMe there's no annoying advertising, and it's available worldwide.\n\nCross Platform - for many systems\n=======================\nAppMe is currently available for iOS: iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Android. Parallel logins on multiple platforms is no problem; all data will be synchronized live.\n\nPrivacy \u2013 full control and security\n=======================\nAppMe respects the privacy of its users and does not transfer any private data (like your local address book, GPS position, etc.) without your explicit approval. Even other settings like your public profile or the live display chat can be individually activated or deactivated. All data transfers take place over a secure SSL encryption system.", "artistName": "Internetq SA", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1810.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d7/6f/d3/d76fd359-07af-bb05-2a3e-fab9333e9819/mzl.zxegtsee.png", "version": "2.0.1", "primaryGenreId": 6005, "primaryGenreName": "Social Networking", "fileSizeBytes": "14622049", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "AppMe Chat Messenger", "genreIds": ["6005", "6016"], "trackName": "AppMe Chat Messenger", "releaseNotes": "Due to many requests, public chats are back!", "sellerUrl": "http://www.app.me", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/eb/d8/cb/ebd8cbc3-bcfa-474c-59d0-a478d2ad60b3/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/22/2c/aa/222caa69-25d8-04f8-40d6-72c5c242403a/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/e3/fd/a9/e3fda93d-504f-308f-624f-af7fd4d2cb87/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c7/80/d3/c780d30f-d0ca-8e07-2de2-755896c61f5e/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/04/51/b8/0451b856-0dac-7fd6-7288-48c5487549d4/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 314, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/internetq-sa/id362100035?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 3.0, "sellerName": "Internetq SA", "supportedDevices": ["iPodTouchourthGen", "iPhone5", "iPhone4", "iPadMini", "iPadWifi", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone4S", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPhone-3GS", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPad2Wifi", "iPad3G", "iPhone5c", "iPhone5s", "iPadThirdGen"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1810.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d7/6f/d3/d76fd359-07af-bb05-2a3e-fab9333e9819/mzl.zxegtsee.png", "bundleId": "com.oxolo.appme", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appme-chat-messenger/id509161291?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1537.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ea/d5/dc/ead5dc4d-15e3-39f7-d3b1-d50d6ed43d9e/appicon.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
