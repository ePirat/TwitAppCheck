Not good enough... you need MOAR updates? \n\nYou're killing us here, but fine, we give up. We'll throw in a \"zany frame pack\" with crazy angled frames into the mix (...yes, these do work with the video slideshow maker). \n\nIf you haven't bought any in-app-purchases yet to support us, now's your chance!
