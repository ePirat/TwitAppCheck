Put the Bible into your daily life. Every time you look at your device! \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Over 1,000 custom Bible-based iPhone & iPod Touch Lock Screens \n- iOS 7 Support & New Design\n- iPhone 5 support for all images\n- Thumbnail view!\n- Categories (New, Popular, Love, Relationships, Encouragement, Prayer, etc.)\n- 15-second Video Devotionals (from our Instagram page)\n- Universal App optimized for iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch! \n- Weekly updates based on new app architecture!\n- iPad-specific images, perfect for Landscape & Portrait modes\n- Tap and hold to save to your Camera Roll on your device \n- Many more Bible Lock Screens\u2122 (not available online) \n- Suggest a Verse (suggest verses for new Bible Lock Screens\u2122) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\niPhone users look at their lock screen many times a day, to use their phone, to check the time, or to use one of the millions of apps available on the iOS platform. \n\nThe lock screen appears for about eight seconds and is the first thing you see when you use your iPhone. Eight seconds is a lot of time to be looking at something random. Why not use a background with Scripture on it! \n\nMy heart is that these Bible Lock Screen backgrounds would help remind you of what the Word of God says and help you walk it out. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nAPP STORE REVIEWS: \n\n\"This app is a GREAT buy!
