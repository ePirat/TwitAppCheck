It\u2019s designed so you don\u2019t have to mess with timers, alarms, or typing. All the important stuff can be entered with a one-finger tap. View all eat/sleep/diaper events for each day, or view the combined history of any individual activity. As you continue using the app, you\u2019ll be able to view trends from day to day, week to week, or month to month.\n\nUnlike some apps, Eat Sleep isn\u2019t overflowing with features you may not need. A real, working, first-time mom helped design the app so it\u2019s simple and easy to use. Eat Sleep tracks the information your baby\u2019s physician cares about most without being needlessly complicated.\n\nEat Sleep also includes a simple note-taking feature which allows you to track special events or routines. You can also now track multiple children.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nEat \u2013 Track how long your baby was breastfed and which side. You can also track the amount of formula or pumped breast milk your baby consumed.\n\nSleep \u2013 Simple options and no calendars to mess with. Select when your baby finished sleeping and approximately how long\u2014the app does the rest! Intuitive menus help jog your memory and let you enter blocks of time quickly.\n\nDiaper \u2013 Keep tabs on diaper changes and whether diapers were wet, dirty or both. This is especially important for breastfeeding moms who need to know if their baby is eating enough!\n\n---\n\nEat Sleep is free but does contains ads. You can simply remove these ads while also supporting the makers of this app through an in-app purchase on the settings screen.\n\n----------\n\nNeed help with the latest version of Eat Sleep?
