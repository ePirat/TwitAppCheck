Well, today, we\u2019re very proud to continue with our mission of pleasing some of the people some of the time with this new release of Camera+!\n\nTo kick things off, we have a new Pro quality setting. For those of you who are willing to sacrifice your precious storage space for the sake of capturing and saving the absolute highest quality images you can get with your iPhone, this feature\u2019s for you. With this setting, your photos are stored and processed in the TIFF format with lossless compression. Pro quality isn\u2019t the kind of setting you\u2019ll typically want to use all the time, but for those extra-special shots where you want the utmost in quality, this will definitely do the trick.\n\nNext up is a little enhancement that we\u2019ve added to our innovative Front Flash. Before this update, you were limited to either having it on or off. But now in Camera+ 6.1, you also have an Auto setting for it so that you can let the little gnome that lives in your iPhone decide whether it should be on or off. Because gnomes know best. This, of course, leaves you with one less thing to think about when taking selfies so you can simply focus on doing your best pre-2014 Ren\u00e9e Zellweger impression. And yes, we want to see those, so please share!\n\nAnd lastly, this is for all of you who\u2019ve left burning brown bags of unmentionables on our stoops for us killing iOS 7 support in Camera+ 6. You poomongers will be very happy to hear that version 6.1 works on iOS 7. Of course, you won\u2019t have the benefit of being able to use the new manual camera controls, macro mode, and Photos extension that are only available on iOS 8, but those are just an OS upgrade away for you when you\u2019re ready. We\u2019ll wait patiently\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s it for now. We\u2019ve got some big things coming down the pipeline for both this iPhone version of Camera+, along with a huge, long-overdue update for the iPad version.
