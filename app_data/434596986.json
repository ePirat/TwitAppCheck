Does your child need to practise their spelling and times tables? Are you looking for inspiration for projects and assignments?\n\nThe School A to Z app is an essential tool for every parent of school-aged children. Produced by the NSW Department of Education and Communities, the School A to Z app brings together a wealth of resources to help parents to understand and support their child's homework.\n\nFeatures\n\nOur 'English A to Z' has more than 350 definitions of commonly-used English terms from primary and high school. Each word has an easy-to-understand definition based on the current school curriculum, with graphic illustrations and help sheets to help you.\n\nWith nearly 300 definitions, our 'Maths A to Z' will help you to understand what is happening in your child's classroom. Each word has an easy-to-understand definition based on the current school curriculum, with graphic illustrations, help sheets and 'how to' videos to help you support your child.\n\nTechnology is changing at an ever-increasing pace and - as a parent - it is not always easy to keep up with the latest trends and terminology. Our 'Technology A to Z' explains these terms in language that you can understand.\n\nOur 'Spelling Bee game' provides hours of spelling fun for children of all ages. The Spelling Bee game is powered by words from Australia's national dictionary, the Macquarie Dictionary (Macquarie Dictionary Data (c) Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 2012). There are three levels of difficulty and a leader board to track progress and improvement. Children can even create their own games for their spelling homework.\n\nIf your child needs help with their times tables, then the 'Maths Monkey Times Tables' challenge is sure to be a winner. Your child has to get the most number of correct answers before all of the bananas fall. Children can choose which number they want to practise and there is also a random game to keep them guessing.\n\nDoes your child have an assignment due tomorrow and you don't know where to start? We have prepared some 'assignment starters' for common classroom topics and themes to point you in the right direction.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy-to-use guide to help your child with their homework, then this is the app for you!", "artistName": "NSW Department of Education and Communities", "artworkUrl512": "http://a358.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9c/bd/6c/9cbd6c69-34eb-7c23-937e-00b424835a17/mzl.iozokfbg.png", "version": "1.8", "primaryGenreId": 6017, "primaryGenreName": "Education", "fileSizeBytes": "41370237", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "School A to Z", "genreIds": ["6017", "6016"], "trackName": "School A to Z", "releaseNotes": "Fixed iOS7 related issues, including the microphone no longer working and list index deletion issues.", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6c/8a/ed/6c8aedd6-e13f-426f-795d-cb3a579f718a/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/29/22/75/29227576-c5d2-c4ae-05ea-f12d481a1172/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/6f/bd/7d/6fbd7d13-0319-9670-6064-dcf0ac00f91e/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/ce/4d/bc/ce4dbc42-ba95-c1da-8f55-1eb31f23a069/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9a/62/15/9a621573-9b35-1654-a6b0-0f39a727dacb/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 10, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nsw-department-education-communities/id404107271?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "sellerName": "NSW Department of Education and Communities", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5s", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPad2Wifi", "iPad23G", "iPhone5c", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadMini", "iPadFourthGen", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone5", "iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone-3GS", "iPhone4"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a358.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/9c/bd/6c/9cbd6c69-34eb-7c23-937e-00b424835a17/mzl.iozokfbg.png", "bundleId": "au.edu.nsw.det.School-A-to-Z", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/school-a-to-z/id434596986?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "6.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a156.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e1/01/f9/e101f986-0d37-fc92-85af-24d6c9e94ab8/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
