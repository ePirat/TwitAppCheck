To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period.  Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app.  Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month.  The only fail-safe method to prevent unwanted pregnancies is abstinence from sexual intercourse.  If one chooses to engage in sex, we strongly recommend understanding the risks and birth control options to mitigate those risks. Users may remove fertile window and intimacy icons from the calendar in the app settings (Period&Fertility/ AbstinenceMode).\n\nPlease email comments and suggestions to supportgpa@gmail.com.", "artistName": "GP Apps", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1006.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/3c/4a/8a/3c4a8a9b-e9b2-a444-e59f-8b13aef8ca11/mzl.nekmfuwe.jpg", "version": "9.3.1", "primaryGenreId": 6013, "primaryGenreName": "Health & Fitness", "fileSizeBytes": "32175338", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Period Tracker Lite", "genreIds": ["6013", "6012"], "trackName": "Period Tracker Lite", "releaseNotes": "Design improvements to Notes, Log, and Settings pages.\nCompatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+.", "sellerUrl": "http://www.gpapps.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/98/a9/bf/98a9bfe3-ecbc-facd-d296-ffda84945875/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/89/fa/bc/89fabcd0-7162-38f0-5b9d-efdcb0013d07/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/64/da/06/64da06f6-b699-5e32-068d-335e2f2d758b/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/49/6d/70/496d70fc-fe76-9ebf-1677-355789574c28/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/2e/0e/e9/2e0ee974-3e1e-52e5-2d00-a115635aca1a/screen322x572.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 50361, "trackContentRating": "12+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gp-apps/id289078803?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "sellerName": "GP International LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone4", "iPadMini4G", "iPadFourthGen", "iPhone5", "iPad3G", "iPadWifi", "iPhone5s", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPad23G", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPhone5c", "iPadMini", "iPhone-3GS", "iPhone4S", "iPodTouchourthGen"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1006.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/3c/4a/8a/3c4a8a9b-e9b2-a444-e59f-8b13aef8ca11/mzl.nekmfuwe.jpg", "bundleId": "com.gpapps.ptrackerlite", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/period-tracker-lite/id330376830?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1450.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/ed/f4/af/edf4afd3-a25d-a3a9-32ba-cc9f02470d23/lite_icon.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
