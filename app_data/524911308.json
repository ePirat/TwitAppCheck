You can add them by downloading them from existing users or by their URL.\n\nThen, enjoy your skins! They all appear on the home page of the app. Just click a single button corresponding to the skin you want to wear: BAM, it's uploaded on minecraft.net, and everybody can now see it in-game!\n\n\n*** HOW TO ADD A SKIN! ***\n\n1- Click the settings icon and fill in your Minecraft account credentials (don't worry, they're stored with love!)\n2- Close the settings window, and click \"+\" on the main screen.\n3- Choose wether you want to save a skin that someone is already wearing, one that you found on the Internet (\"from an URL\"), or if you want to search for something new directly from the app.\n4- Type the username, URL, or search for a skin you like, respectively.\n5- Choose a name for the save of your skin (\"Banana\" can be an awesome name for a banana costume, for example) and a description, if you wish.\n6- Click next, and let the magic happen.\n\n\n*** COMPATIBILITY NOTES! ***\n\n- You can NOT change your skin on Minecraft Pocket Edition at the moment.
