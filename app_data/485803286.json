That\u2019s why our Mandarin app includes 8 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific skill for speaking Mandarin and helps create a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes well beyond basic flashcards.\n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Chinese words, phrases and grammatical points with which you\u2019ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Mandarin, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience.\n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Mandarin, MindSnacks is like your own personal Chinese teacher you can take just about anywhere. You\u2019ll quickly become less reliant on that Chinese dictionary and learn the grammar and vocab you need for traveling in China.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.
