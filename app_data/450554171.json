Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Portuguese words, phrases and grammatical points with which you\u2019ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Portuguese, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners, MindSnacks lets you learn Portuguese at home, on the bus or during lunch breaks. You\u2019ll soon spend less time looking at that translation dictionary and more time letting those Portuguese words roll right off your tongue.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.
