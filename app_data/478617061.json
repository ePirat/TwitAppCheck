Annotate, animate, and narrate nearly any type of content as you explain any concept. Teachers can create short instructional videos and share them instantly with students, or ask students to show what they know and help friends learn something new.\n\nINSTRUCTION THAT'S READY WHENEVER YOU ARE\nFinished lessons are stored securely in your online Educreations account, so they're available whenever and wherever you need them. You control who sees what. Even if something happens to your iPad, all of your videos are safe.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE DIGITAL CLASSROOM\nCreate classes that students can join right within the app. Lessons sync automatically between teacher and student iPads, so it's easy for students to access teacher instruction and for teachers to monitor student work. Students without iPads can access classes and lessons on the Educreations website.\n\nSHARE INSTANTLY\nLessons can also be shared via link, email, Messages, Facebook, Twitter, or by embedding them on your blog or website.
