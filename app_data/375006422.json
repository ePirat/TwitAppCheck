Nebulous Notes is the text editor of choice for professionals.\n\n(If you want to try-before-you-buy, check out \"Nebulous Notes Lite.\")\n\n## ABOUT ##\n\nNebulous Notes is the text editor of choice for professionals. I get emails from correspondents at BBC, writers for the New Yorker, and businessmen trying to organize their thoughts. I'm also working on a 200+ page book myself, so I use my own app every day.\n\nAll notes in NN are backed up to Dropbox, because I care a lot about text files. Notes aren't stored in some vague format that is hard to export (think GDrive or Evernote), but rather in plain-old text files that you can point to.\n\nNebulous Notes is also the ONLY iOS text editor that selectively edits and syncs text files in any Dropbox folder seamlessly. It took 3 years to make it this smooth, but it's crucial because not everybody has all their text files in one single application folder.\n\n## FEATURES ##\n\n  * Open and edit all plain-text files (.txt, .md, .c, etc.)\n  * Save files to Dropbox\n  * Note: you cannot edit Word Documents or PDFs\n\n## FEATURES USERS LOVE ##\n\n  * Open files from ANY Dropbox folder\n  * Full Dropbox file search\n  * Pinch-to-zoom on text\n  * Laser-like attention to detail on plain-text editing\n  * Selective file syncing\n  * Flush, full-screen support for \"Writeroom\"-style editing\n  * Macro system lets you add an extra row of keys to the keyboard\n  * The macros can include single characters, or whole strings of characters\n  * Macros also include programmatic shortcuts like timestamps and inserting newlines\n\n## MORE FEATURES ##\n\n  * Preview files in HTML, MarkDown, MultiMarkdown, Rich Text-RTF\n  * Supports saving and opening in all file encodings (useful for international users)\n  * VoiceOver hints\n  * Print documents using AirPrint\n  * Save in Evernote\n  * Tag Files\n  * TextExpander support\n  * Customizable themes\n  * Protect the app with a PIN\n  * \"Insert Tab\" key (multi-line tabbing and un-tabbing supported)\n  * One-click access to MarkDown/HTML previews\n  * Turn off word-wrapping\n\n## REVIEWS ##\n\n\"Wow, I do so LOVE your app.\" - Merlin Mann, creator of 43 Folders\n\n\"This is quite possibly the best tool for any writer, blogger, or journalist that needs to get work done on-the-go\" - AppAdvice.com\n\n\"If you feel really geeky about your note-taking, give Nebulous Notes a shot.\" - geek.com", "artistName": "Nuclear Elements, Inc.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1962.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e3/8e/18/e38e1830-80ca-56c1-3b05-e2ba06b1e325/mzl.sgkmmjpa.png", "version": "7.1.2", "primaryGenreId": 6007, "primaryGenreName": "Productivity", "fileSizeBytes": "15304900", "price": 4.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Nebulous Notes", "genreIds": ["6007", "6002"], "trackName": "Nebulous Notes", "releaseNotes": "This fixes a critical bug for some people.
