I love it!\u201d \u2013Meaghan Merrill\n\n**Keep friends and family separate**\nLife360 Circles allows you to organize your friends and family into unique groups. You\u2019ll start with a Circle for your core family \u2013 mom, dad, kids \u2013 but the sky\u2019s the limit! If you\u2019re the Circle admin, you get to decide who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out.\n\nCreate Circles for your cousins or other extended family, add a Circle for your nanny or babysitter, or create a temporary Circle for the Little League team\u2019s trip to the playoffs. \n\nIf you have friends or family who\u2019d rather not be connected, that\u2019s okay, too! Circles will allow you to keep them separate when you need to.\n\n**You control your information**\nLocation, messages and Places are all tied to your Circles, so you can check in with your Grandparents Circle and not the book club. Need your daughter to pick up milk on the way home from soccer practice? Message your Family Circle and not your best friends.\n\nYou can pause location sharing to any Circle at any time, which is perfect for caregivers who don\u2019t need to share their location 24/7. (Or for anyone who just needs a little \u201cme\u201d time.)\n\n**Take the guesswork out of your day**\nIf you often find yourself texting \u201cdid you get there okay\u201d or \u201cwhen will you be home,\u201d Life360 Places is for you. Create zones around your home, work, school or anywhere you visit regularly. Whenever someone in your Circle arrives or leaves, you\u2019ll get a notification letting you know.\n\nPlaces are Circle specific, and you set your alert preferences. Get alert notifications for arrivals and/or departures, and decide whom you want to associate with each Place.\n\n**Kick it up a notch**\nWith Life360 Premium, you get the best of Life360 and then some. For just $5/month or $50/year per Circle, you get:\n* Access to a 24/7 Live Advisor, a real person who can see your location and assist your family in an emergency and provide roadside assistance\n* Unlimited access to Life360 Places and history data\n* $100 in stolen phone protection\n* Unlimited location information for non-smartphones, up to six non-smartphones per Circle \n\nWith Life360, you can also:\n* Check in to let your Circles know you\u2019re okay\n* Get driving directions to people in your Circles\n* Track a lost or stolen phone\n* Utilize the Life360 panic button, which will send a voicemail, email and app notification to everyone in your Circles, letting them know you need help\n\nDisclaimer: Continued usage of location services while the app is in the background can excessively drain battery.", "artistName": "Life360", "artworkUrl512": "http://a641.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/bf/59/be/bf59bee6-dd77-44cb-7343-b90063eed792/mzl.biepjjcl.png", "version": "7.2.0", "primaryGenreId": 6005, "primaryGenreName": "Social Networking", "fileSizeBytes": "25028702", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Life360 - Family Locator, Messaging and More", "genreIds": ["6005", "6012"], "trackName": "Life360 - Family Locator, Messaging and More", "releaseNotes": "- NEW - Create accounts using your mobile number\n- Streamlined invite flow, makes it even easier to invite your friends and family to join you\n- Minor improvements and bug fixes", "sellerUrl": "http://www.life360.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/49/17/b0/4917b076-ce9b-fa1b-e77e-5ba3f7a25dd2/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/92/08/52/92085217-e587-4ac7-5f72-ea51d143c6e3/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/05/d6/f6/05d6f6e2-6cac-413d-dd65-4b245989c847/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/7c/3a/d4/7c3ad487-1c6b-a027-c222-76a538f1e7d0/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/e7/9d/31/e79d3150-54e2-66c2-d4ed-a7e3132430d0/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 26033, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/life360/id309681604?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.5, "sellerName": "Life360", "supportedDevices": ["iPadFourthGen4G", "iPad23G", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5c", "iPhone4", "iPhone5", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone4S", "iPadMini", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5s"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a641.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/bf/59/be/bf59bee6-dd77-44cb-7343-b90063eed792/mzl.biepjjcl.png", "bundleId": "com.life360.safetymap", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/life360-family-locator-messaging/id384830320?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1743.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/e0/2d/d7/e02dd7b0-b3ac-84bf-58fe-8fe3e1251480/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
