At the bottom of this page, there\u2019s a \u201cFile sharing\u201d section \u2013 just select OPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don\u2019t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the \u201cFile sharing\u201d tab, and they\u2019ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend\u2019s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.\n\n- What kind of streams does OPlayer play? \nOPlayer is able to play RTSP/MMS/FTP/SAMBA streams, If you want to use OPlayer to open the streaming from your website, add \"oplayer:\" prefix in the URL.\n\n- I want to open an attachment from mail app with OPlayer? \nIf you want to watch an attachment in OPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick OPlayer as a player.\n\n- iTunes won\u2019t see the files under OPlayer? \nYou need to enable backup in the settings page to see files in iTunes.\n\n- Why HD MKV movies don\u2019t play smoothly? \nCurrently, only iPhone4s supports 720p MKV file, that\u2019s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n- The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable \"Skip Frame\" in the file detail page.\n\n- Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, but TV-out function only supported by iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.\n\n* Contact us\n\nTwitter: @OLIMSOFT\nMail: olimsoft@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.edavs.com", "artistName": "olimsoft", "artworkUrl512": "http://a182.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/0a/38/f1/0a38f1a5-30e5-39c7-f418-7d830d09c77a/mzl.bwvmljrb.png", "version": "2.1.01", "primaryGenreId": 6002, "primaryGenreName": "Utilities", "fileSizeBytes": "31208677", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "OPlayer Lite", "genreIds": ["6002", "6011"], "trackName": "OPlayer Lite", "releaseNotes": "- Add flat UI for iOS8.
