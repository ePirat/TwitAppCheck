The \u201cYouTube for audio\u201d analogy looks increasingly apt, especially if its metrics continue to shoot skyward.\u201d - ReadWrite\n \n\u201cSoundCloud is a sharing machine. Remember the early days of audio online \u2014 when you had to download the Real Player or Windows Media Player to listen? The days of downloading before listening are over.\u201d - USA Today\n \n\u201cIt's an evolution of audio's most vital self-service creation and discovery platform, music's best analogue to Twitter, YouTube, and Kindle Direct Publishing. It's not just finding or sharing songs or podcasts or spoken-word readings your friends may be listening to \u2014 it's finding and sharing the people who make those recordings, too.\u201d - The Verge\n\nCOMMUNITY\n \nLike what you hear?
