That\u2019s why our Italian app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the Italian language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Italian words, phrases and grammatical points with which you\u2019ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Italian, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience.\n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Italian, Mindsnacks is like a helpful new Italian teacher that fits in your purse, pocket or ever-fashionable fanny pack. You\u2019ll quickly become less reliant on that Italian dictionary so you can focus on more important stuff like booking your trip to Venice.\n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.
