This fabulously fun and educational app lets your little one dial the phone and chatter away without ever making a real call.\n\nWith the simple press of a button, you can download the interface onto your iPhone or iPod touch and instantly transform it into a pretend phone complete with an oversized screen that's easy for small fingers to manipulate.\n\nWhen your child hits a number, the phone speaks the number and displays it as both a digit and a word.   Hit the musical note and get an upbeat rendition of \"London Bridge Is Falling Down.\"   Push the bubble icon and release a stream of bubbles sure to provoke a giggle fit.\n\nInspired by kids' endless fascination with the phone, BabyCenter's PhonyPhone\u00ae app will keep your child happily entertained while mimicking grown-up telephone time.
