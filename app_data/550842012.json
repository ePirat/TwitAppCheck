Millions of people use it to find and buy products they love.\n\n1. Every day, Wanelo will show you new amazing products just for you. As you save products you like, Wanelo learns about your style. The more you use it, the better it gets!\n\n2. Use the app to browse and search across all of your stores in one place! From tiny boutiques to all the big brands you know and love, you can keep all of your shopping organized on one place.\n\nWe should mention that Wanelo is dangerous for your free time and wallet. Our users think so, too:\n\n\"You're like my life, Wanelo.\"\n- Caitlin (@caitlincugini)\n\n\"So I guess you could say I'm a little obsessed with Wanelo #noshame\"\n- Brie (@BriNastiii_)\n\n\"Wake up, check Wanelo. Lunch break, check Wanelo, go to sleep, still checking Wanelo. I think I need therapy.\"\n- Jackie (@jackiebianchino)\n\n\"I spend hours on Wanelo I swear. It's my addiction.\"\n- Mikayla (@Mama_Cooley4)\n\n\"I wish I had all the money in the world.

It's good to be alive, right?!\n\nThree giant, earth-shaking things in this update:\n\n1. BUY THINGS. Without leaving the app! Look for the special Buy button with the Wanelo icon. A few taps and BAM! -- the object of your desires is on its way to you. Just like that.\n\n2. PRIVATE MESSAGING. Finally! Chat with friends about the fantastical things you're finding. It's dangerously fun. Or just plain dangerous. On iPhone only right now.\n\n3. FILTER BY STYLE. Your search results -- filtered by Classic or Trendy or Bohemian or Urban or Active. And more! Soft Grunge might be coming back; just wait a minute. It's cool though.\n\nAnd our new app icon will remind you about the gifts you need to buy for friends and family. Check our Holidays category under Search for gift ideas, and share your Wanelo to get what you want this year. We got you covered on both sides. \n\nWe love you people. Send us an email in the middle of the night (hello@wanelo.com) or leave us a review! We'll read it and respond quickly.
