Unfortunately, the update we pushed out on Monday in spite of having very, very minimal changes related specifically to iOS8 managed to drag in with it some unexpected new issues related to jumping from the original code (built on iOS5 and 6) to iOS8. Those issues tended to manifest themselves in part based on specific user data and scenarios we didn't catch or were unable to catch in testing.\n\nWe have since expanded our beta test group and put this version through more rigorous testing to ensure the bugs reported on 2.6 are now fixed.\n\nWith that being said, we are very near completion of a major Gas Cubby 3.0 update on totally new code and with a much-improved user experience. If you can hang in there with us for just a bit longer we're sure it will be worth the wait.", "sellerUrl": "http://www.fuelly.com/gascubby/", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/95/01/85/9501852f-168e-bfcc-023e-2d032c059fb6/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/db/00/08/db000802-b19f-cad9-0881-0123e29e5ca0/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/b9/49/00/b949000e-d57f-c153-3121-d398695fa245/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/06/c9/a1/06c9a175-556b-7dd9-8b94-d84a07868472/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/27/e1/33/27e13313-a1a4-d7e5-b70d-1bee16c57bb0/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 3179, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/fuelly-llc/id666506117?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 2.5, "sellerName": "Fuelly, LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone4", "iPadMini4G", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadFourthGen", "iPhone5c", "iPadMini", "iPhone5s", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPad23G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPhone4S", "iPhone5", "iPad2Wifi"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1981.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/04/fe/fa/04fefaeb-1fd6-aaf7-a200-a62041d18381/mzl.gbnfifmz.png", "bundleId": "com.appcubby.gascubbyfram", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gas-cubby-free-fuel-economy/id347639491?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a300.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/cc/5e/0e/cc5e0e05-5e71-f5a6-ebd1-eb581b6471d9/AppIcon60x60_2x.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
