It is far better than the one I had & well worth 0.99 cents. When I give my old 4S to a family member I\u2019ll share this app as well.\"\n\n\"The Best\nClear, simple and gorgeous. This is the flashlight to beat. Skins, iPhone 5 support and simple mode seal the deal for me. The other flashlight apps are knockoffs.\"\n______________________________\n\nFEATURES:\n\n SuperLED light - Only for iPhone 4, iPhone 4S & NOW FOR iPhone 5\n Strobe mode with different frequencies!\n Colorful Screen lights - for every other iOS device \n Light bulbs \n Animated lighter & candle \n\n\n ADDITIONAL & UNIQUE FEATURES \n\n Built in Compass!\n Built in SOS signal!\n Built in Altitude (Elevation) tracker! \n Built in Live Map (To track usage of this brilliant app through the globe)! \n\n Very simple to use - Just click the power button and illuminate all around!!!\nIn addition to these amazing features, we've redesigned the app so that it looks like real flashlight with real On/Off button and besides now you can change skins!\n\nWe've also added the COMPASS and ALTITUDE info to make our app more valuable.\nAnd finally, what makes our flashlight stand out from others is the interactive map - Check the realtime flashlight usage on the world map. It's really interesting and funny to see that someone\u2019s through the globe has also switched on the Flashlight!\n\nDisclaimer: Continued use of the flash may dramatically decrease battery life.", "artistName": "Lemondo Entertainment", "artworkUrl512": "http://a310.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/3d/fc/b4/3dfcb485-c20f-aad4-b5eb-cf39f11f90fc/mzl.vxnzdqml.jpg", "version": "3.10", "primaryGenreId": 6002, "primaryGenreName": "Utilities", "fileSizeBytes": "25570091", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Flashlight for iPhone , iPod and iPad", "genreIds": ["6002", "6012"], "trackName": "Flashlight for iPhone , iPod and iPad", "releaseNotes": "- Optimised for iOS 8\n- Crash bug fix for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus\n- Other minor improvements", "sellerUrl": "http://www.lemondo.com/products", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/92/61/62/926162e2-d6b2-046a-bbbd-8f5c5f05078b/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/82/64/74/82647480-53fb-3f26-9e44-738cf1a7576a/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/00/90/9d/00909d4d-7d10-5c08-d532-568d7156f39d/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/9d/9b/e9/9d9be995-fa5e-737e-a491-727c9b561ecc/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/3b/40/7b/3b407bfa-a511-98df-1b87-41401fa187f0/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 20901, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/lemondo-entertainment/id406195207?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.5, "sellerName": "Lemondo Ltd.", "supportedDevices": ["iPadMini4G", "iPad23G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5c", "iPhone5s", "iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadThirdGen", "iPadMini", "iPhone4"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a310.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/3d/fc/b4/3dfcb485-c20f-aad4-b5eb-cf39f11f90fc/mzl.vxnzdqml.jpg", "bundleId": "27W7W2CQJT.RealFlashlight", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flashlight-for-iphone-ipod/id388838723?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a782.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/1a/70/78/1a707815-2999-0da9-bb11-a8eff313f723/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
