Oh! You didn\u2019t see that coming now did you. Look at that face. Latin America and Asia represent!\n\nMexico City aka Distrito Federal. Enough with the #firstworldproblems, it\u2019s time to help some real people. So begins our broader international expansion into emerging markets where some of our greatest work is to be done. Hola to 21 million Chilangos. We have the Metro, the Metrobus, the trolleybuses, the lightrail as well as the suburban rail, the RTP buses, and the ecobici! We also have line incidents. Oh and the peseros, they will come. Ahorita, ahorita. \n\nBaby Tokyo. Ok to be honest, we\u2019re going early on this one, the data is incomplete, there are no buses. Even Citymapper can\u2019t handle the Tokyo. Just yet. But there is some real-time and disruptions and the app is in Japanese. Or so we think. This is the first step folks. Will the baby grow up?\n\nExisting cities, please know that adding more cities does not make the app slower. However still using iOS6 will. We have more:\n- Improved fengshui when you use nearby stops/ departures and My Stops.\n- Get Me Home and Get Me to Work are now easier to edit and share, just tap the Triple Dots. Hope you find them. \n- Get Me to School. You can now change Work to School. Those of you in school, seriously don\u2019t leave, work is overrated anyway. Especially transport apps, mad difficult.\n- Various bugs squished, data and routing improvements. \n\nAs the app gets more complex, please know that we will also continue to simplify. The world gets bigger. The world gets smaller.
