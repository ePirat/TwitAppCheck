From first-time runners to marathon veterans, you'll get the measurement and motivation you need to run farther and faster than ever before. Welcome to the world\u2019s greatest running community.   \n \nGUIDANCE AND TRAINING \nWhether you\u2019re looking to take on your first 5K or smash your marathon PR, Nike+ Coach gives you training programs, coaching expertise and daily workouts to get you race ready. \n\nTRACK YOUR PROGRESS\nStay on track, no matter where you are. On the trail, treadmill, or streets, your iPhone\u2019s GPS and accelerometer accurately track your distance, pace and time. You can also track your metrics at every mile with in-run audio feedback.\n \nSTAY MOTIVATED\nShare your runs and let your friends keep you going with cheers along the way. Show off your Nike+ level color and amp things up with a PowerSong at the press of a button.\n \nCOMPARE AND COMPETE\nNothing's as motivating as a little friendly competition. Compete with your friends for the top leaderboard spot, or go toe-to-toe against them in a Nike+ Challenge. Just set a distance. Invite your friends. And race to the finish.  \n \nCAPTURE THE MOMENT\nShow off your run with a thousand words. Take photos before, during and after your run. Customize them with your route, metrics, and of course, a swoosh.\n\nAPPLE HEALTH\nConnected for Health\nBy accessing your Apple Health  data, Nike+ can give you even more detailed information about your run, including heart rate monitor support in-run when using a Bluetooth 4.0 enabled device like Wahoo\u2019s Tickr products.\n\nNeed help?

This update is focusing on addressing the issues with playing music while you run.\n\nMusic controls are now tied to your run controls so when you stop running your music will pause as well. You can control this feature in your Settings section of the app.\n\nSkip, add or change your music on your run at anytime by swiping left from the in-run screen for dedicated music controls. Be sure to set a PowerSong to give you an extra boost.\n\nRun with music from other apps like iTunes Radio, Spotify, or AudioBooks in the background by tapping Other App in your run setup. \n\nThere are more updates on the way.
