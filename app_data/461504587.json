You\u2019ll know exactly what needs to get done, who\u2019s going to do it, and what\u2019s coming up next. Plus, everything you do is synced and saved instantly to the cloud so that all your devices are always up to date.\n\nWith Trello, you can create boards to organize anything you\u2019re working on. Use them solo \u2014 or invite colleagues, friends, and family to work together.\n\nWrite your ideas down on Trello cards and arrange them in lists on your boards. Add details to your cards such as\n\n\u2022 Checklists to keep track of to-dos;\n\u2022 Comments to update your co-workers;\n\u2022 Photos, videos, and PDFs;\n\u2022 Or just who\u2019s working on it currently.\n\nWith the Trello app in your pocket, you can make to-do lists while waiting in line at the grocery store, assign tasks to your co-worker while you\u2019re on the train home, or upload a photo of that paisley couch you saw the store \u2014 it would look lovely in the living room, wouldn\u2019t it?", "artistName": "Fog Creek Software", "artworkUrl512": "http://a154.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/2f/f0/29/2ff029b0-52b2-ed7c-f8b1-30d0665322bd/mzl.wztdyczn.png", "version": "2.6.3", "primaryGenreId": 6007, "primaryGenreName": "Productivity", "fileSizeBytes": "21217821", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Trello - Organize Anything", "genreIds": ["6007", "6000"], "trackName": "Trello - Organize Anything", "releaseNotes": "iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users, rejoice! We have more pixels for you.\n\n~ HEY ~\n\nHey. Remember when a single pixel could render an entire phone? You'd have a blue pixel for your background, and it would turn red if you got a telegraph.\n\nCut to: 1999! Windows 98: Second Edition. The first phone with a second pixel. Who doesn't remember waking up on a snowy nondenominational morning, rubbing the snow out of our eyes, and finding that 2x1-resolution monitor underneath the holiday tree?\n\n~ THESE DAYS ~\n\nThese days we take our pixels for granted. So, as we spruced up the app and fixed bugs in this release, we asked ourselves:\n\nAre we taking pixels for granted?\n\nWill we wake up one day and find our devices blank? Will we look into our stock tickers and phablets and \u2318HOROMETERs only to see our faces, sadly staring back at us? Will we have to forge on with our lives, without our shiny friends?\n\nWill we put on a jacket and race out the door, hailing a taxi as our long hair blows in the dawn's wind \u2014 \"The airport; and step on it!\" \u2014 whereupon arrival we buy the cheapest ticket going anywhere spread across all the credit cards in all our wallets, a ticket we shove into the officer's hands as we rush past our TSA Precheck, and, and, And what if our pixels left? What would we do? Where would we go? And but so we make it to the gate during last call and we see the pixels looking uncertainly out the window, nervously fingering the tags on their luggage, and then they see us \u2014 They See Us \u2014 and in their light and in that moment we know that we could never truly be separated as long as there's even one boolean of truth and beauty in our universe.\n\nAnyway, that's all in this release.\n\n~ ANYWAY ~\n\nStay tuned! We have big things planned.\n\nPlease as always leave feedback for us inside the App Store. I believe the URL is http://appstore.geocities/~trello?
