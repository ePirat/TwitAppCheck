You can save your favorite places, share places with friends, and access any places that other people have created and shared publicly. Think of it as a Foursquare for navigation.\n\nUse Falcon to:\n\u2022 Find buildings on a college campus\n\u2022 Navigate music festivals\n\u2022 Save your parking spot\n\u2022 Share a meetup spot with friends\n\u2022 Save waypoints along a hiking trail\n\u2022 Locate your favorite rides at a theme park\n\nFalcon's navigation works like a compass, pointing directly to your destination, showing you its distance and direction. Falcon also lets you save your favorite places individually - or grouped together as \"Maps\" - to use again later, share with friends, or make publicly available. All Places and Maps that are made public are available and accessible to everyone on Falcon. Think of it as a people-powered database of all the hidden places and locations on the map!\n\nThe music festival season is starting, and you can use Falcon at any of these events to mark and share your your camping spot, your meetup spot, or any other point of interest. \n\nHere at Falcon we're big fans of Coachella, but you can use Falcon at many other events like SXSW, Snowball, Beyond Wonderland, Ultra Music Festival, Stagecoach,  and many more!\n\nAs an official partner of The Campus Companion, Falcon is teaming up to also help students find their way around their college campuses.\n\n***Disclaimer***\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "artistName": "The Hatch Studios", "artworkUrl512": "http://a84.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/fd/50/66/fd5066a5-53d5-7e6b-5d1a-8067d7d4d440/mzl.ckpimion.png", "version": "3.1.0", "primaryGenreId": 6010, "primaryGenreName": "Navigation", "fileSizeBytes": "9478712", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Falcon - Navigation for Colleges and Festivals", "genreIds": ["6010", "6005"], "trackName": "Falcon - Navigation for Colleges and Festivals", "releaseNotes": "New Social Features!\n\n- Create an account to send spots to your friends\n- Send spots to friends via the Falcon app, text message, or Facebook message\n- Conversations are now sorted by most recent, making it easy to send places to your closest friends with ease", "sellerUrl": "http://www.facebook.com/falconapp", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/82/a4/65/82a4650a-9be6-8f3f-812f-762c104ae5d0/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/25/64/01/25640139-f156-5761-87a2-3c284cde5ccd/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e6/fa/b5/e6fab5fd-65e5-d057-61cf-03d27b806015/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/b8/c1/0e/b8c10e09-1cfd-e07a-fb63-f9b29161b284/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/88/3e/db/883edba1-abcb-51a8-17e3-8bfeb0f21023/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 52, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-hatch-studios/id506151546?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "sellerName": "Matthew Austin", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5c", "iPadMini", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadWifi", "iPad2Wifi", "iPad3G", "iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen", "iPhone4", "iPhone-3GS", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone5s", "iPhone5", "iPodTouchFifthGen"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a84.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/fd/50/66/fd5066a5-53d5-7e6b-5d1a-8067d7d4d440/mzl.ckpimion.png", "bundleId": "the.hatch.Falcon", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon-navigation-for-colleges/id506151543?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "5.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1943.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/54/e0/d8/54e0d827-c256-2f03-8025-d51da71a20dd/Falcon.png", "averageUserRating": 5.0}
