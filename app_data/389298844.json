Just flip the switch in the bottom right corner to switch from still capture to video capture, and back again!\n\nCOMPLETE CAMERA ROLL INTEGRATION: Tap the icon in the bottom right corner to open the Camera Roll. There, you can view your pictures, pinch-to-zoom, rotate, share them via email or MMS, copy them, or watch any of your videos!\n\n3x3 GRID: Align your photos using a grid, so you never have to worry about the rule of thirds again!\n\nFULLSCREEN BUTTON: Just tap anywhere on the screen to take a picture. No more looking for that tiny camera button! Plus, it has a second function! If you are using antishake, sound capture, or timer, and realize you just want to take the photo already, tap anywhere on the camera preview to instantly take the picture!\n\nBURST MODE: Take three photos right after one another, so you don't have to worry about missing those quick moments!\n\nZOOM: Just like the default Camera app, zoom in up to 5x, and get the highest possible quality!\n\n..and much much more!\n\n*Follow @TestutTech on Twitter for all the latest news on updates*", "artistName": "Testut Tech", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1149.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/d0/d5/f5/mzl.yegqcnzh.png", "version": "2.0", "primaryGenreId": 6008, "primaryGenreName": "Photo & Video", "fileSizeBytes": "5232340", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Camera Prime", "genreIds": ["6008", "6012"], "trackName": "Camera Prime", "releaseNotes": "IMPORTANT: Make sure you have launched Camera Prime AT LEAST once.
