After all, it's the food that matters.\n+ Keep up with friends and see what they're eating. Follow friends, or anyone so long as they have great tastes! \n+ Find out \"what's good here\". No more relying on the waiter.  \n+ Browse menus by the highest rated items, what your friends have had, or any other way you choose.\n+ Check out photos of the food before you order. \n+ Comment on friends' food experiences. \n+ Track what you've had and where. Never forget a food adventure. \n+ Instant sharing to Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou're hungry, at a new restaurant, and you don't know what to order. You're really hungry. There is no room for order-error here. You tell the waiter your predicament and ask \"what's good\". A blank stare, a pause, and his eventual response of \"everything\" is troubling as you stare at a menu longer than the morning paper. You take a chance, order the duck because it sounds big, and anxiously await its arrival. Minutes later you are confronted with what perhaps once was a duck, but now looks more like a deflated bird and a bone. You attempt to find an edible portion but are unsuccessful. You leave, even hungrier than before, longing for a better way to eat out. \n\nWe don't want this dining mishap to happen to you. Download Nosh and ensure you will never go hungry again.", "artistName": "Switch Communications, Inc.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1464.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/83/8d/e9/838de991-c7be-9b73-3042-7d848e1411dd/mzl.rnilebsq.png", "version": "2.0", "primaryGenreId": 6023, "primaryGenreName": "Food & Drink", "fileSizeBytes": "11375829", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Nosh", "genreIds": ["6023", "6003"], "trackName": "Nosh", "releaseNotes": "Search and map good food near you filtered by keyword and distance.\nQuick Nosh.\nBrand new UI.\nNotifications list.\nPreferences page for managing notifications.\nGallery view for menu item pictures.", "sellerUrl": "http://www.nosh.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/c7/9e/4f/c79e4f1b-2b7b-1c66-25e9-4d6b1cc4d928/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e7/9c/12/e79c1298-f075-06e4-efb0-b824b3e40a6a/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e8/0f/6b/e80f6bf8-c44e-24cd-e2c0-2c6d5fc36d7c/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 61, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/switch-communications-inc./id442976549?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 1.5, "sellerName": "Switch Communications, Inc.", "supportedDevices": ["iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5", "iPhone5s", "iPadFourthGen", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPad2Wifi", "iPad23G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone4", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPad3G", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone-3GS", "iPhone4S", "iPadMini4G", "iPadWifi", "iPadMini", "iPhone5c"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1464.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/83/8d/e9/838de991-c7be-9b73-3042-7d848e1411dd/mzl.rnilebsq.png", "bundleId": "com.firespotter.nosh", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nosh/id442976546?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "5.1", "artworkUrl60": "http://a466.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d3/f3/fa/d3f3fae9-2202-1e7e-d552-aff09d329a1b/Icon.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
