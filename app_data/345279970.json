Saved me from running back and forth to the stereo all night, plus I was able to remotely queue up song requests.  It was the hit of the party.  I highly recommend.\" \n\n\u201cFinally--a remote that does what a simple remote should do. Remote works great. Allows me to control iPad music--song selection, volume, pause/play, skip/repeat--from my iPhone. It's handy, especially when working around the house\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly what I was looking for! After countless research I finally decided to give this a try. It does exactly what it says it will. I have complete access to my iPad 2's music library from my iPhone 4s. I can control my iPad (which is hooked up to my outside stereo) from anywhere in my yard.... Even with a weak wifi signal.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent. Works flawlessly, great for playing music from your iPad or any iOS device remotely. Great job developers. You did something Apples Remote app should be capable of by default.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat remote app. This app, after constant searching, is one of the best remote control apps to use between my iPad and iPod touch. I plug my iPod into my home media and use my iPad (to play and queue songs) wirelessly on my network. Amazingly well structured app 5/5 stars! Nice work guys!\u201d\n\n\u201cOutstanding app! I thought \"someone should make an app that does this.\" Then I looked and there it was! Tango. Works exactly like was thinking it should. Best app on my phone (and iPad).\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have. Remote songs and volume from the patio and never get up. Works just fine via the stereo system. Way cool.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn a word it's PERFECT!\"\n\nWhat's missing from Apple's Music App?
