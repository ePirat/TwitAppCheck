With Flip, home buyers rate every house by tossing bad matches into the trash and saving good ones for later.\n\nEstately for iPhone has gained remarkable traction and a large following in just six months on the app store. The app has received hundreds of 5-star reviews and great reviews from the media and home buyers alike. We are blown away by the reception. \n\nHome buyers who beta tested Flip are addicted.
