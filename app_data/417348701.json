This is one of the best motivation apps to date. I am constantly trying to get more xp then my friends and I got to say, It's fun! Since I have been using this app I have lost a total of 24+ pounds and only need to lose about 20 more pounds! If you are having trouble losing weight than this app is great for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI lost 35 pounds in the past 11 months and this app kept me motivated to keep going!! What are you waiting for... Trim that butt and that belly and go tell a friend!\u201d\n\n\"I lost my fitbit, which was connected to LoseIt... Then I found this app, which keeps me motivated and requires less logging!\"\n\n\u201cI was looking for an app to help motivate me in my fitness goals, and this is perfect. Everyone is so encouraging and within a short time I had new friends motivating me and encouraging me to be fit! It's this type of support that I needed. Now I'm looking forward to 'compete' and push myself to reach my goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternal motivation wasn't working for me\u2026 This time last year, I was happy to get two workouts in a week\u2026 Now, I can't imagine going a day without exercise\u2026 This app works for me. I hadn't been able to make the lifestyle changes I needed to make without it!\u201d\n\n\"I have never worked out before downloading this app, it makes working out fun and makes me want to do it everyday. This app has been amazing to my physical and mental attributes, my friends have made remarks noticing the difference and I tell them it's all because of this app!\" \n\n\u201cI NEVER have bothered writing a review before- but this app is worth it. It is fun, motivating, and challenges you to move up levels... Psyched! Lost 3.8 pounds in a week with the help of this app! Awesome!\u201d\n\n\"After trying many devices (some medical grade ;) that cost an arm and a leg this application works seamlessly with no actual money invested! Five stars!!!\" \n\n\"I read about this app in Shape magazine and decided to try first during a a workout at the gym. Before I knew it I was Nexercising daily (not just at the gym) when walking, cycling on my bike route to work, and even while doing housework. Who wouldn't love a simple way to journal activity and win stuff!??\"\n\n\"Whether you are strength training, doing intensive cardio, or just taking a simple walk - this app turns routine ho-hum into play. Plus the community provides better motivation than apps with detailed nutrition support or calorie burning information!\"\n\n\"I stumbled across this mPoint app while searching for star diets in the livestrong MyPlate app. I love being able to earn rewards for exercising by going for a run with my trainer. I combine this with RunKeeper and it's goal setting while prepping for my race - it's like a fitness buddy who hands out prizes ( Kiip and mPoints :) !\"\n\nWith almost 200 activities, Nexercise is the perfect community based motivational coach and training tool for any diet or weight loss program. \n\nRequired Disclaimers: \n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
