This technology is faster than traditional radar and is used for air traffic control and navigation. ADS\u2010B is not used by all airlines or aircraft, however this is changing and the number of aircraft tracked by ADS\u2010B is increasing all of the time. Traditional radar type data in near real time is also included for North America; this is subject to a short time delay. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The use of the information presented using Plane Finder is strictly limited to pursuing enthusiast activities (i.e. for entertainment purposes), which specifically exclude any activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.", "artistName": "pinkfroot limited", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1008.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/27/81/aa/2781aa77-18a1-f2b1-063b-fa21ee1f8015/mzl.ydzrnzjr.png", "version": "7.4.2", "primaryGenreId": 6010, "primaryGenreName": "Navigation", "fileSizeBytes": "24191355", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Plane Finder Free", "genreIds": ["6010"], "trackName": "Plane Finder Free", "releaseNotes": "Thanks as always for all of your feedback and comments. \nWe do listen!
