Racing\n- Launch and shift when the dashboard indicator turns blue or green \n- If there is too much wheelspin, you are not going anywhere - watch the orange indicator on your dashboard \n- Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy \n- Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!\n2.
