We highlight human struggles and achievements, empower impassioned voices, and challenge the status quo. \n \nIt is more than just another news app. It's a community. Putting you at the heart of stories that impact your life.\n \nOur content is broken down and presented in cards: \n \nVideo Card: Bite-Size, Shareable and engaging. Video cards aim to empower you with relevant information that contextualizes the world around you. From 6second headlines videos, through to 3min explainers and up to 7min documentaries, videos designed for a generation on the move.\n\nDebate Card: Who doesn\u2019t love a good debate? We know most issues have different viewpoints. These cards allow you to vote on a certain issue, take a stand and advocate your position within the community.\n\nConversation Card: Tired of trolls? This is the space to dive deeper into issues. We know we don\u2019t have all of the answers (even though we\u2019d like to think we do). A conversation card connects you with a global community to engage and learn from each other.\n\nQuiz Card: Think you know everything? Take a quiz and test your knowledge. Quiz cards introduce a new and fun way to explore stories. \n\nArt Card: Who doesn\u2019t love sharing a good quote or compelling stat? Lucky for you, we love data! The art card is designed to highlight key data points around issues. They\u2019re designed for you to share to your social networks.  \n\nResource Card: Let us Google that for you. We know people spend more time searching for additional info on stories. This card will make your life a bit easier with links to relevant stories, articles and bits of information.\n \nCards are organized in a collection we like to call stacks. Making it easy for you to dive deeper on topics that matter to you. Stacks never really disappear; they simply get refreshed as the stories rise to relevance.\n \nEMPOWER. ENGAGE.
