This effect draws the viewers' attention to the colored areas, creating striking images.\n\nThe intuitive and responsive multi-touch user interface makes Color Splash amazingly easy and fun to use. Use your finger as a brush to \"paint\" sections of your image black and white, or to bring back the original color.  Zooming in and out using the two-finger pinching gesture allows you to work on details with pixel-accuracy.\n\nFeatures:\n- Short tutorial videos explain the use of all features and will have you editing your images in minutes.\n- Choose photos to edit from your iPhone photo library or from Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Google+, Picasa or Flickr.\n- Share your edited images on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr or Picasa. Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save multiple sessions to resume your work later.\n- Undo any number of accidental brush strokes.\n- An alternative view mode highlights the regions that will remain in color with a red tint. This makes it easier to see and adjust the boundaries between color and black & white regions.\n- Choose from 4 different brushes (hard or soft edged, opaque or transparent) and adjust the brush size.\n- Hide the toolbars in full screen mode.", "artistName": "Pocket Pixels Inc.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1702.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/e0/09/ab/e009ab49-37c1-e270-39c0-5beae285f2dc/mzl.sesqmgef.png", "version": "3.2.1", "primaryGenreId": 6008, "primaryGenreName": "Photo & Video", "fileSizeBytes": "21745694", "price": 0.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Color Splash", "genreIds": ["6008", "6016"], "trackName": "Color Splash", "releaseNotes": "- Added back access to the Camera Roll album in iOS 8.1 \n- Minor bug fixes", "sellerUrl": "http://www.pocketpixels.com/ColorSplash.html", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/07/b9/0d/07b90df8-9976-9864-5495-9419370aea19/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/52/32/9f/52329fff-a0a6-2459-8e8e-fcdd81262eb5/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/ca/ca/b3/cacab31d-3d69-c1b0-8f89-e37b3125f0eb/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/9f/5e/09/9f5e0915-3dce-c0bd-d2c6-d4e0410668bf/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/55/2b/01/552b01d8-a04e-e786-6212-e1c449165fde/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 29313, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "$0.99", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/pocket-pixels-inc./id292628472?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "sellerName": "Pocket Pixels Inc.", "supportedDevices": ["iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5s", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadMini", "iPhone4S", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadThirdGen", "iPad23G", "iPhone5c", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone5", "iPhone4"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1702.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/e0/09/ab/e009ab49-37c1-e270-39c0-5beae285f2dc/mzl.sesqmgef.png", "bundleId": "com.hkueck.colorsplash", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-splash/id304871603?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a137.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/c6/1b/15/c61b150d-8cb2-0b76-96ab-498200f777f7/icon-57.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
