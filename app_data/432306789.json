During the \"bad update\" period I tried out two other highly rated paid apps. While they indeed have the same goal and mostly found the same words and point values, this app had by far the best user interface. The others felt clunky and half finished. They took longer to scan and were not as intuitive to use. \nI didn't enjoy using them as much and eventually quite using a cheat app altogether. If you need and or want a good \"helper\" tool for \"Words With Friends\", you can't go wrong with this app. Even if you only use the free, truly ad-free one and decide not to pay for the highest scoring words.\n============================================\n\n\nThe creators of this app are in no way affiliated with the authors of Words with Friends, or any other app, game, licensor or trademark mentioned in this description or in the app.", "artistName": "RedSpell", "artworkUrl512": "http://a727.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/e4/b0/b0/e4b0b01c-17c8-f836-8d6c-4f91defb3797/mzl.vkhyrfjz.png", "version": "3.5", "primaryGenreId": 6016, "primaryGenreName": "Entertainment", "fileSizeBytes": "28086368", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Words with free EZ Cheats \u2013 auto cheat with OCR for Words With Friends game (HD version supported)", "genreIds": ["6016", "6014", "7019"], "trackName": "Words with free EZ Cheats \u2013 auto cheat with OCR for Words With Friends game (HD version supported)", "releaseNotes": "* New Words With Friends supported\n* fixed issues with iPhone 6+ zoomed display mode screenshots", "sellerUrl": "http://ezwordcheats.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/80/09/c1/8009c10f-69dd-e87b-bca1-95fddf2436f8/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/57/79/c1/5779c186-4f7b-76a5-1490-c1bffaf8667b/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/bf/e4/d7/bfe4d769-2292-445b-e1e0-1e947c8743b5/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/17/67/7f/17677fb9-ccca-48e7-1c6d-c10f9acbc9de/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/26/d2/52/26d252ed-1f06-1651-789f-d9449782d828/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 119494, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/redspell/id432306792?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.5, "sellerName": "RedSpell", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5s", "iPad2Wifi", "iPhone-3GS", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadThirdGen", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPad23G", "iPadMini", "iPhone5c", "iPhone4", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone4S", "iPadMini4G", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPhone5"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a727.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/e4/b0/b0/e4b0b01c-17c8-f836-8d6c-4f91defb3797/mzl.vkhyrfjz.png", "bundleId": "com.redspell.wwfc", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/words-free-ez-cheats-auto/id432306789?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "6.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1612.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/b0/fe/ae/b0feaefb-bfec-8bb6-2649-bf655958d841/Icon_U007eiphone.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
