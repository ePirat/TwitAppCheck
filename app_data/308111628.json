It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages, like uploading photos on flickr.com or Facebook.com.

You can easily add new search engines. Search suggestions from google and yahoo can be activated on the iPad. It's also possible to search within a web page. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically).
