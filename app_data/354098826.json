Penultimate combines distraction-free, natural handwriting and sketching with the power of Evernote\u2019s sync and search. Take class or meeting notes, journal your thoughts, or outline your next big idea\u2014in the office or on the go. From the first stroke, Penultimate makes the experience of pen and paper more productive.\n\nINK AND PAPER, MADE BETTER\nNotes and drawings look spectacular in black or colored ink. Our inking technology produces pen strokes that look natural, and Wrist Protection prevents stray marks for writers of all grips. Choose from a number of paper styles, or import an image to create personalized paper.\n\nSTYLUS AND SOFTWARE BUILT TOGETHER\nWe worked closely with Adonit to create the stylus we've always wanted: the Jot Script Evernote Edition, the first true precision-point stylus. Penultimate integrates tightly with the stylus and together they make digital handwriting the experience it should be. It\u2019s like writing with your favorite pen. Available now in the Evernote Market.\n\nYOUR WRITING KEEPS PACE WITH YOU\nPenultimate lets you work on any part of the page effortlessly. To zoom in on a location on the page, simply pinch in and start writing.

Your Penultimate notes are synced to Evernote automatically, so you can find and share them across all of your devices.\n\nFIND WHAT YOU NEED QUICKLY\nNo matter how you prefer to organize your work, Penultimate makes it easy to find the notes you need. Penultimate processes your notes so you can search for handwritten text in the app. Save and browse your work in notebooks and insert, delete, duplicate, and reorganize pages any way you like within them.\n\nGET MORE WITH PREMIUM\nPenultimate is free to download and use.
