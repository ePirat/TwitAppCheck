Belly users scan their card or app at the in-store tablet, earning points that are redeemable for rewards unique to each Belly business.\n\nWith Belly, we offer one customer loyalty card to replace the rest. Link the mobile app to your physical BellyCard, which can be picked up at any Belly location. Use the app's \"Nearby Places\" feature to find locations to Belly when you're out on the town. Earn a free cup of coffee at the donut shop down the street. Name the Sandwich of the Month at your local deli. For the first time, you can have your cake and eat it too, or at least have the option of shoving it into your baker's face.\n\nBelly is fully integrated with Passbook! Add a Pass for each of your favorite Belly Businesses. In the Belly app, select a business and tap \"Get Pass.\" Passes make it even easier and faster to Belly.\n\nTry out our Belly Bites!
