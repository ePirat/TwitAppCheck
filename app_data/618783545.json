As you were.\n- Fixed: 3rd party keyboards broke the file upload screen\n- Fixed: When the keyboard was dismissed by swiping down, the chat window would then partially scroll back up, which was interesting, but not in a good way\n- Fixed: Tapping the text input field while in any channel or private group while the keyboard was minimized caused the keyboard to then overlap the text input\n- Fixed: Rejiggered the file list view navigation bar that overlapped \"Everyone\" or \"Just You\" labels\n- Fixed: The cool but unhelpful fake name (null).slack.com was displayed while joining a new team via the sign in flow. It isn't any more\n- Fixed: Brought back the missing back arrow from the flexpane file view on iOS 7\n- Fixed: On iPads running iOS 8, the text input that would bounce after sending a message has been told very firmly to chill out\n- Fixed: @everyone in a non-general channel would show the correct dialog but didn't post the message to #general as expected\n- Fixed: Embarrassing typo in Skype username placeholder text has now been corrected\n- Fixed: @autocomplete now works properly with VoiceOver.
