Capture the moment and send a gorgeous personal keepsake to be treasured for years. Create unique custom-designed postcards using your own photos or Bill's expressive nature photos, and send them as eCards, or as real printed and mailed postcards. Type or dictate a message on the back, and add decorative stamps and stickers. Make your creation even more personal with custom stamps and stickers of your own images, and finish with your signature.\n\nYou can send an unlimited number of PhotoCards by email free of charge, or have us print large 8.25 x 5.5 inch cards using the highest quality color printing and mailed by USPS for a small fee.  Start by choosing one of the app's 220 built-in nature photographs or one of your own personal photos. Adjust the rotation, zoom and crop, lighten or darken your photo, and let PhotoCard analyze and automatically enhance it. With a tap, flip the card over and type or dictate a personal message on the back. For a fun touch, you can jazz up your card with decorative stickers and stamps, and sign it with your own custom signature. Email cards can even include a recorded voice note. When you've finished your creation, you can send it off to any email or postal address in the world! \n\nThis Lite version was made small enough for cellular download by including only 20 of Bill\u2019s nature photos, 20 stamps, and 20 stickers. The full version is exactly the same app, also free, but it must be downloaded over a WiFi connection because it includes 220 nature photos, 220 stamps, and 440 stickers. \n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 No frustrations. Simple, intuitive, and fun graphical user interface.\n\u2022 No delays. Within minutes of thinking about a friend or family member, you can have a personalized PhotoCard on its way to their postal mailbox or sent directly to their email Inbox. \n\u2022 Make it postcard-perfect. Use one of Bill\u2019s stunning nature photos, or resize, crop and adjust one of your own newly-taken or existing photos. \n\u2022 Write your message on the back of your card using any available font, size, and style. \n\u2022 Edit in place and get what you see with full-screen page layout. \n\u2022 Decorate PhotoCards with your choice of playful stickers and colorful stamps. \n\u2022 Record voice notes, up to 60 seconds, and include them in your emailed PhotoCards. \n\u2022 Personalize your postcard with custom stamps, custom stickers, and even a custom hand-written signature.\n\u2022 Sending PhotoCards via email is always free. \n\u2022 Sending print-and-mail cards to the USA costs as little as $1.50, including first-class postage, and as little as $2.25 to other countries.\n\u2022 Large 8.25 x 5.5 inch cards are printed with a state-of-the-art HP Indigo digital press and laminated for lasting protection.\n\u2022 Address correction makes sure your card is deliverable as addressed. \n\u2022 A graphical confirmation email informs you when your card is being printed, and another email when it has been mailed.\n\u2022 A sent card history shows you all the cards you\u2019ve sent, and lets you open a new, editable copy to start a new card.\n\u2022 Browse a world of beauty wherever you go.  PhotoCard includes a collection of Bill's finest nature photographs and a limited license to print and mail these copyrighted photos. \n\nBrought to you by Bill Atkinson, author of Apple\u2019s original QuickDraw, MacPaint, and HyperCard software.
