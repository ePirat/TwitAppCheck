We apologize for those bugs. If new bugs arise, rest assured that they too will be fixed.\n\nThanks to all our customers, new and old, for all the feedback on Ita 2.0! We\u2019re grateful for all our customers, and we\u2019ve got more great updates planned.\n\nAnd for those of you seeing Ita for the first time, the release notes for 2.0:\n\nHi. We're happy to announce Ita 2.0!\n\nFor 2.0, we\u2019ve completely redesigned Ita. Even the icon is new. We\u2019ve also added some new features that we\u2019re excited about. For example: tapping list items while editing switches editing focus, making it possible to edit multiple items in quick succession. We\u2019ve moved Ita\u2019s settings into the app (tap the atom symbol in the top left) to make it easier to access and change your settings. Ita 2.0 also improves its support for accessibility features and adds translations of the app into Traditional Chinese and Modern Greek.\n\nWe  couldn\u2019t be happier with the customers, testers, localizers, and developers that have helped us make Ita a success.
