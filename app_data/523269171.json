It was created by doctors and athletic trainers.\n \nWe asked coaches what they'd want most in an app like this, and the top suggestion was lightning tracking followed by heat index information. If lightning strikes nearby, this app sends an alert to the phone and displays the strikes on a map.* Heat index is calculated based on the nearest weather station to your phone. The resource section gives information on what to do to keep yourself and your team safe. *Lightning data requires an annual in-app subscription.\n \nWith this app, you can:\n\n\u2022See lightning strikes within 30 miles of your location and track lightning strikes within 6, 12 and 30 miles (requires annual subscription)\n\u2022Monitor heat index and wind chill\n\u2022View current temperature and humidity\n\u2022Access information that athletic trainers commonly share, such as hydration and nutrition tips, injury prevention, concussion guidelines, and when to go to the emergency room\n\u2022Build team contact lists and use the group texting feature to make game day and practice updates a breeze\n \nThough CoachSmart was developed with coaches in mind, it is a great tool for anyone involved in outdoor activities such as fishing, camping, cycling and golf.", "artistName": "Vanderbilt University", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1613.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/62/7f/fa627fc7-e23a-6194-2396-d8ebad2135df/mzl.unhcpzqf.png", "version": "2.0", "primaryGenreId": 6013, "primaryGenreName": "Health & Fitness", "fileSizeBytes": "3775482", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "CoachSmart", "genreIds": ["6013", "6004"], "trackName": "CoachSmart", "releaseNotes": "Annual in-app subscription now required for lightning tracking", "sellerUrl": "http://www.vanderbiltsportsmedicine.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/dd/87/c1/dd87c16e-5689-a8d2-e445-b5bd04a84612/screen322x572.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d5/1b/f3/d51bf341-1ebc-162d-06ed-fdbf4570423f/screen322x572.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 37, "trackContentRating": "12+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/vanderbilt-university/id353785823?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "sellerName": "Vanderbilt University", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone-3GS", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone5c", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadWifi", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPhone5s", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPad2Wifi", "iPhone4", "iPad23G", "iPhone4S", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPad3G", "iPadMini", "iPhone5"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1613.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fa/62/7f/fa627fc7-e23a-6194-2396-d8ebad2135df/mzl.unhcpzqf.png", "bundleId": "edu.vanderbilt.coachapp", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coachsmart/id523269171?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "5.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1356.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f7/5a/07/f75a0789-29b6-f96d-cc44-91349b888135/appicon.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
