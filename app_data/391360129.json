The game is also a useful tool for OLSAT, ERB, or Stanford-Binet test preparation.  Our mission is to enhance the cognitive skills of young children through fun and engaging iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad applications.\n \nFor each question, your child will see five pictures appear on the screen, one of which does not fit with the others. The child advances to the next question by dragging the picture that does not belong into the trash can in the lower left corner. To improve vocabulary and word retrieval, encourage your child to look carefully at the choices first.  Then, ask your child to say the name of each picture. \n \nBefore your child drags the picture to the trash can, expand the learning experience by asking your child to identify WHY the picture does not belong and WHAT the other pictures have in common.  For one picture to \"not belong,\" the other four pictures must having something in common.  For example, \"The cheese does not belong because it is not a fruit.\"  If your child needs assistance, offer a choice (i.e. \u201cIs it a fruit or a vegetable?\u201d).  Help your child gain a clear understanding before moving on to the next question.\n \nLearning can be an exciting and valuable way to interact with your child.
