It\u2019s fixed now.\n- All is right with the world: YouTube track playback is fixed.\n- Not a new thing in this release, but we wanted to be clear: we *are* running video ads now. However, we've restricted them to pre-roll ads -- which only play at the beginning of a listening session -- and we're committed to running these only infrequently.*\n\nNew in 3.0:\n- Momma\u2019s got a beautiful new look\n- Animated playlist covers like we\u2019re in Harry Potter or something\n- 8tracks Timeline: review playlists you\u2019ve heard and upcoming playlists, travel through time and space.\n- New Home screen: automatically shows what you listen to most\n- Sleep timer: go to sleep whenever the heck you want without leaving the app running\n- Tumblr sharing, in addition to Facebook, Twitter, text, email, link, Tinder (just kidding\u2026maybe)\n- Performance improvements and bugs swatted\n- Sidebar access to your playlist collections\n\n*We know you\u2019re bummed about this, but we want to be able to provide 8tracks to you for free, which requires the occasional video ad to help defray the substantial cost of royalties we pay to artists and labels. Alternatively, for $20, you can buy a full year of totally ad-free listening. Grab it at Settings > Ad-free on iOS > Upgrade.  Questions?
