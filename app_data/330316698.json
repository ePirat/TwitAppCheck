I use it to show people where I am, my eta, to coordinate several people meeting at the same place coming from different directions... It gives people peace of mind, and the option to see it in a web browser is awesome for those who don't yet have the app. Also, it's nice that you can set the Glympse to expire upon arrival for saved battery life.\u201d \u2013 Bradley Dunham via iTunes\n\n5 Stars - \"Thanks u guys!!!
