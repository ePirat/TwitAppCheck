Go to your iPhone / iPod's homescreen.\n2. Press the lock button (at the upper right of the device) and keep it pressed - and press the homebutton at the same time\n3. Let go of both buttons and you should hear a camera click sound - the screen will go white for a second. If you don't get the sound and white screen, repeat steps 2 and 3 until it works.\n4. Now start iDestroy and start a new \"destruction sandbox\" game.\n5. Go to the weapons menu (upper right corner, the yellow grenade) and in the following screen,  tap the blue icon \"custom background\".\n6. Your photos will be shown - the last of which should be your homescreen, pick that one.\n7. Start the destruction :) \n\nWe would like to thank all the fans of iDestroy! \nYour good iTunes reviews and ratings keep us motivated to keep updating\niDestroy!", "artistName": "Stark Apps GmbH", "artworkUrl512": "http://a385.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/3a/4d/ee/3a4dee37-b1e5-46fa-d747-089a283243d1/mzl.umkqsaft.png", "version": "7.2", "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "28052905", "price": 0.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "iDestroy\u2122 - Call of Bug Battle", "genreIds": ["6014", "6016", "7001", "7003"], "trackName": "iDestroy\u2122 - Call of Bug Battle", "releaseNotes": "fixed free DP menu", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2a/5d/79/2a5d798b-8262-b316-8f9c-0a5fa0c794cd/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2b/50/95/2b509584-b659-1aa2-9370-fae7d77671b1/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e0/5b/0d/e05b0d8e-3a14-0eb0-81d2-425efb3299fc/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/dd/d8/68/ddd868df-a8dc-acea-18c9-e12a9328e807/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/f1/60/85/f1608553-6d7d-90bc-831e-d37046e5cb02/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 7733, "trackContentRating": "9+", "formattedPrice": "$0.99", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/stark-apps-gmbh/id309689111?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 3.0, "sellerName": "Stark Apps GmbH", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone-3GS", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPhone4", "iPhone4S", "iPhone5", "iPad2Wifi", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5c", "iPadMini", "iPhone5s", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPadMini4G", "iPadFourthGen"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a385.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/3a/4d/ee/3a4dee37-b1e5-46fa-d747-089a283243d1/mzl.umkqsaft.png", "bundleId": "idestroy-full", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idestroy-call-of-bug-battle/id309689677?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "6.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1855.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e6/9a/49/e69a497a-b562-d425-7a46-5829d59c9623/Icon.png", "averageUserRating": 3.5}
