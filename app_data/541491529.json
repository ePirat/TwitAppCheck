It's creative, with no preset answers -- a funny, unpredictable, mind-melding, turn-by-turn game where you have to think like your friends!\n\nSay the Same Thing is the word game where you and a friend win together! You each start by entering a random word and then you each guess a word that connects those two, something they both have in common or a bridge between them (see some examples in the screenshots). Repeat with each new pair of words until you Say the Same Thing!\n\nFEATURES:\n\n**Play with Friends on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch\n\n**Win Together\nIf you both say the same thing in the same round, you win!\n\n**Funny Stamps and Emoticons\nLet Your Partner Know When Their Guess is Funny, Witty, or Ridiculous!\n\n**Chat with Friends\nDiscuss Your Brilliant Game As It's Going On and After!\n\n\nA TOTALLY UNIQUE WORD GAME EXPERIENCE:\n\n**Think Like Your Friends\nPlaying Say the Same Thing is like getting inside the head of your friend.  You have to be smart to win.\n\n**Totally Creative\nYou create the game together as you play, there are no preset answers.  \n\n**Different Games with Different Friends\nWhen you play different friends, you\u2019ll have very different types of games -- different jokes, different answers, different concepts.\n\n**Improvisational\nYour games will veer off in surprising directions and that reflect what you are thinking and feeling that day.\n\n**Spend Time with Friends\nPlaying is almost like hanging out together and spending time with a friend or family member.  Seriously.  You are being creative, thinking about each other, and exploring your shared understanding of the world.  But it\u2019s also simple and fun.  There\u2019s no other game like it.\n\nBecome a Fan!
