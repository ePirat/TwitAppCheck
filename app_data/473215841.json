As always, access to snow conditions and five-day weather forecasts are right at your fingertips. And now, you can easily find everything you need to know about a particular resort on a single, scrollable page. \n\nChoose your own adventure! REI Snow Report works great as either a ski app or snowboarding app. It can help you decide the best place to ski or snowboard by sending alerts when there\u2019s new snow at the base depth levels you\u2019ve set. Make the app your own by adding up to 15 resorts from all over the world to your Favorites. See at a glance where it\u2019s a good powder day so you can jump out of bed and get going! (We won\u2019t tell your boss.)\n\nNeed more details? The app lets you reference trail maps for most North American ski resorts, look at web cams where available, and find out how many lifts are open so you\u2019ll know what to expect ahead of time. Avoid the bad surprises and bring on the spontaneous outdoor fun! \n\nIf you\u2019re heading up with friends, share snow forecasts with them via Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS, and in our app. You can stay on top of changing mountain conditions through participating Twitter feeds.
