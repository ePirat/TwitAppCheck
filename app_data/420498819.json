That means if there are no bouquets, you will be unable to see any servies.\n\n\u27a0 Screenshots\nOn iOS 3.2 upwards you can save the current screenshot by holding your finger on it for one seconds. You can find saved screenshots in the picture reel.\n\n\u27a0 Streaming (Enigma, Enigma2, Neutrino)\ndreaMote does not contain a video player at the moment. To start playback of a video stream you have to have a supported Streaming-App installed. As of now these are OPlayer (HD) (including the free Lite version), BUZZ Player, yxplayer and GoodPlayer.\n\n\u27a0 EPGRefresh\nRequires the EPGRefresh-Plugin from the current \"experimental\"-Tree of Enigma2. Functionality is not given with versions older than 2011/05/22.\n\n\n\u2665 Please consider buying the Pro version if you like this software? Here are just a few reasons\u2026 \u2665\n\u2022 No advertisements\n\u2022 Support of future development (there are already over three years of work put into dreaMote)\n\u2022 Multi-EPG\n\u2022 Emulated EPG-Search for non-Enigma2-Receivers\n\u2022 (Enigma2) AutoTimer-Support\n\u2022 Preferred (earlier and possibly more often) updates\n\u2022 More Features (and thereby reasons to buy the paid version) to come with future updates\n\n\nPlease be aware of that fact that we cannot add features that the hardware does not support. This includes starting your receiver remotely if it was turned off and emulating remote control buttons that the original remote control does not have.
