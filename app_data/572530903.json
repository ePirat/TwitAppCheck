What should I do? \nSince Google+ has not released an official API for app developers yet, we\u2019ve come up with our own solution, developed in-house, to allow you to post to both personal and company Google+ pages. Here are some solutions that may help you add Google Plus:\n\n- Google+ will not connect because I have Google 2-Step Verification activated. You will need to disable Google 2-Step Verification in order to connect your Google+ account to Everypost. Please visit this link on your device to disable 2-step verification: https://www.google.com/settings/security After disabling Google 2-Step Verification,\n\n- I\u2019m still having problems connecting Google+. Some users have received an additional error, even after disabling 2-step verification. In this case, you will need to complete the Google Unlock Captcha so as to allow Everypost access to your account from a new application.
