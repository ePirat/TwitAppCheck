The guys on MISTER are real men: confident, strong, down-to-earth men who have experience in the things that matter. Whether you're over 30 \u2014 or just love grown men \u2014 it's time to become a MISTER.\n\nFEATURES\n- MR. Right learns what kinds of men you like and sends you personalized introductions everyday\n- Matches: We'll let you know when you and another member both \"Like\" each other\n- Multiple Views: More ways to view the men on your screen. See who\u2019s nearby, who\u2019s far away, who\u2019s interested in you and more.

Suit-and-tie professionals and carefree outdoorsmen; tattooed gay guys and big hairy bears; bearded guys, bald guys, jocks, and muscle daddies. They all share the screen on MISTER.\n\nMISTER men are straightforward, honest and generally friendlier than guys on other apps. They\u2019ll tell you if they\u2019re husky or skinny, if they\u2019re HIV-positive or negative, if they\u2019re 52 or 25. And they\u2019re proud of who they are. Most of our members agree to the MISTER Code, a shared set of values regarding mutual respect and safety.\n\nMISTER PREMIUM\nGet even more features when you upgrade to our premium subscription service:\n- See up to seven times as many men as you would on the free version.\n- Online-Only Mode lets you check out only who\u2019s logged in and ready to talk right now.\n- The Travel Feature allows you to pick any city and scan the MISTER scene there.\n- Read Message Notifications let you know the second your message is seen by the recipient.\n- The Private Photo Bucket gives you the power to send additional photos more quickly and store your photos within MISTER.
