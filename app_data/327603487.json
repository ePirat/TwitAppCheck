We think conversation should be easily shared between all of your devices, not trapped as text messages on your phone.  Here's how we do it:\n\n\u2022 INSTANT MESSAGING: Your unique Trillian username can be used to send unlimited messages free of charge.  Trillian uses your existing data plan and/or WiFi.\n\n\u2022 ANYWHERE: Trillian's continuous client feature delivers your chats instantly between all of your connected devices.  In addition, Trillian automatically silences push notifications on mobile devices if you're active on a desktop - no more dealing with a phone buzzing on your desk all day!\n\n\u2022 SIMPLE: Trillian places a strong emphasis on fast and reliable message delivery and a beautiful, easy-to-use interface.\n\n\u2022 SECURE: All communication with Trillian servers uses TLS to ensure third-parties can't read your chats.\n\n\u2022 INTEROPERABLE: Of course, Trillian wouldn't be Trillian without support for Facebook Chat, MSN, Google Talk, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo!, and Jabber.", "artistName": "Cerulean Studios, LLC", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1771.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d7/6f/f2/d76ff263-e121-d57e-c07c-73d8a1f1ecb7/mzl.xpdwwysm.png", "version": "2.1.9", "primaryGenreId": 6005, "primaryGenreName": "Social Networking", "fileSizeBytes": "17279553", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Trillian", "genreIds": ["6005"], "trackName": "Trillian", "releaseNotes": "\u2022 Feature: Trillian to Trillian group chats! \n\u2022 Feature: Devices management in settings.\n\u2022 Feature: Support for Trillian for Business in-house servers.\n\u2022 Fixed: Image downloading failures.\n\u2022 Fixed: Remember state of flash when using camera.\n\u2022 Fixed: Speed improvements.\n\u2022 Fixed: Many miscellaneous bug fixes.", "sellerUrl": "http://www.trillian.im/", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/e5/2b/aa/e52baa04-1891-0bec-fc47-7430f0458fb9/screen568x568.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/65/31/7a/65317a9b-bd46-ac66-d9ee-6f682b1f3f89/screen568x568.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 5373, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/cerulean-studios-llc/id327603490?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 3.0, "sellerName": "Cerulean Studios, LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPadWifi", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone4", "iPhone4S", "iPadFourthGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5", "iPhone5s", "iPhone-3GS", "iPadThirdGen", "iPad2Wifi", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPad3G", "iPhone5c", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPad23G", "iPadMini"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1771.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d7/6f/f2/d76ff263-e121-d57e-c07c-73d8a1f1ecb7/mzl.xpdwwysm.png", "bundleId": "com.ceruleanstudios.trillian.iphone", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trillian/id327603487?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1001.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/d1/c0/ca/d1c0ca9d-ad3f-9a80-7ade-d69429eacb33/Icon.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
