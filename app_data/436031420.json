Tap for the map, pick your driver, hop in and get where you're going. Instead of flagging down a stranger, you get a trusted taxi driver rated by other Taxibeat users. Get a taxi in two taps: One for the map and the other for the driver you want: choose the nearest cab, the nicest vehicle or the most recommended driver. \n\nDon't forget to rate your ride! By rating your ride, you help fellow Taxibeaters find the best drivers in the city and reward drivers for their great service. You can always expect Taxibeat drivers to walk the extra mile for their passengers, as they know this is a one-way street to a 5* rating. \n\nFeatured on TechCrunch: http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/03/taxibeat-leweb/\n\nHow it works: \n* Let the app locate you and tap \u201cSearch for a taxi\u201d \n* Check the list that pops up and choose your driver \n* Hail your driver by a tap on your smartphone \n* Watch him approach the pick-up point \n* Enjoy the ride!\n* Rate your experience with Taxibeat. \n\nTaxibeat is available in Greece, Brazil, Mexico and Peru.\n\nFind us on Facebook: \nwww.facebook.com/Taxibeat \n\nFollow us on Twitter \nwww.twitter.com/taxibeat \n\nWe are always eager to listen to your feedback.
