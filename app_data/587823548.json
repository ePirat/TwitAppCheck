It holds me accountable for making each day count.  \n\nWhen I turn 40, I'll have a 1 hour compilation that encapsulates my 30s.  If I live to see 80 years of age, I'll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\n\nFeatures:\n\n+ The App accesses any videos currently in your camera roll & sorts them by date.  You can also record your moment directly from the App.\n\n+ Setup friendly reminders so you never forget a day!\n\n+ Keep multiple timelines!
