Find out why the world is sleeping better with White Noise Lite for FREE. Features ambient sounds of the environment to help you relax during the day and sleep great at night. \n\nDo you have trouble going to sleep? Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap? Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night? There are numerous benefits to using White Noise: \n\n\u2022 Helps you sleep by blocking distractions \n\u2022 Relaxes and reduces stress \n\u2022 Pacifies fussy and crying babies \n\u2022 Increases focus while enhancing privacy \n\u2022 Soothes headaches and migraines \n\u2022 Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears) \n\nEven when you\u2019re asleep, your brain is constantly scanning and listening for sounds.
