Isolate or remove an instrument from the mix & jam with the original multi-tracks! \n\nAnd now: Line 6 and Jammit have partnered to create the ultimate guitar jam-along experience for iPhone\u00ae and iPad\u00ae. With the Line 6 Mobile In interface and Jammit app, you can immerse yourself in your favorite artists\u2019 original recordings\u2014and play along with incredibly authentic guitar tones.\n\nWhat is Jammit?\nThe audio for the individual instruments and voices heard on your favorite songs was recorded separately before being blended into the final mix.  These original multi-track recordings are the building blocks for every popular song released over the past 50 years and the same authentic tracks that we use in Jammit.\nYes, Jammit actually allows you to isolate or remove an instrument from the mix, so you can jam with a band\u2019s original master tracks! In addition to instrument isolation, Jammit\u2019s scrolling scores, section looping, variable slow mode and onboard recorder let you experience music like never before. Whether you\u2019d like to emulate every nuance of an incredible player or just take in the musical genius of a great performance, Jammit software allows you to find out what your favorite music is really made of.\n\nBasic Jammit Features:\n\n-True Instrument Isolation: Jammit uses the original multi-track master recordings allowing you to rebalance the mix so you can hear every detail of the original performance.  \n\n-Notation and Tablature: The elite team of Jammit transcribers use the original isolated multi-track recordings to give you transcriptions with a degree of accuracy found nowhere else but Jammit.\n\n-Advanced Tools: Use the variable slow down mode and section looping to focus on difficult musical passages.\n\n-Recording: Whether you're emulating the original part or coming up with your own, you can capture your performance using Jammit's record feature.\n-Line 6 Amp Modeling:\n\nWhen a Line 6 Mobile In is plugged into your iPad or iPhone, it unlocks the Line 6 amp modeling engine that is built in to the latest version of Jammit.  Simply plug your guitar into the Mobile In, launch Jammit and load one of the songs in your library.  There are two ways to use the amp modeling in Jammit : Auto or Manual mode.  \n\nAuto mode: On select songs (see the complete list of eligible songs below), patches have been created to automatically make your guitar sound like the guitar on the original recording. If the tone changes in the song, so does your guitar, so you can concentrate on playing your guitar, not your pedal board! \n\nManual mode: Press \u201cmanual\u201d on the Line 6 user interface (selecting the Line 6 icon under the USER channel title), and scroll through the available preset patches. In manual mode, the sound patch that you select will remain throughout the song. \n\n\nHow to Get Started on Jammit: \n\n1) Download the free app to your iOS 5 iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. \n2) Select the \u201cTry It Out\u201d button to download the 30 second demo songs or\u2026\n3) Sign up for your FREE Jammit account.
