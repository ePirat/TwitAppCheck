This high-intensity training with little rest results in higher daily metabolism and is the equivalent of working out for over an hour - for only slightly longer than 7 minutes. \n\nThe best part? The exercises are simple to perform, do not require any equipment, and therefore, can be done anywhere! NO MORE EXCUSES. \n\nThis app takes this research-proven workout and guides you through the process. Further, it tracks your results, and makes it fun by allowing you to unlock rewards as you continue working out. \n\nApp features include: \n\n- stunning design \n- both male and female trainers that guide you by video, audio, image and text \n- all content is INCLUDED (no additional charges, and no need for internet connectivity) \n- track your weight with our weight tracker \n- track your activity with our activity calendar \n- workout and unlock various achievements \n\nWe are dedicated fitness professionals and app developers.
