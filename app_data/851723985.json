Find the best solution to guide your way through each world as quickly as possible. Watch out for the glowing obstacles. While they look pretty, they are not friendly! Play your friends in real-time with the multiplayer mode or challenge them to beat your scores.\n\nIt\u2019s a race against time to set new high scores for yourself or beat the scores of your friends. Terrella\u2019s companion, Boost, can help her out of a sticky situation. When timed just right, Boost can also help Terrella make it through a level faster to get the top score.\n\nTerralla is for those who love puzzles, have quick reflexes, and can wrap their brains around opposites attracting (this is harder than you think).\n\nFeatures:\n\n* A control system that will challenge your reflexes as well as your mind\n* Multiplayer mode allows you to race against your friends in real-time\n* Chat in multiplayer mode. Talk live with your friends while playing. Warning: Talking smack may occur, but it\u2019s not bragging if you can back it up\n* Levels can be completed in any order\n* A soothing soundtrack\n* We will not nickel and dime you to death.
