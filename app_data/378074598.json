Sylo Synth includes a collection of pre-designed sounds which you can use as they are, tweak them to your heart's desire, or you can make new sounds from scratch.\n\nBuild sounds from basic waveforms, or capture them from the world around you using the iPad's built-in microphone. Then, tinker with Sylo Synthesiser's filters and other settings to make a sound all your own.\n\nSylo Synthesiser features live time-stretching technology based on granular synthesis and a suite of filters:\n\n\u2022 Speed up or slow down a recorded sound to use as an instrument\n\n\u2022 With a regular wavetable synthesiser, higher-pitched notes are also faster, like chipmunks, and lower-pitched notes are also slower, as though they are moving through treacle\n\n\u2022 But enable Sylo's \"Sync Speed\" feature, and lower or higher-pitched notes still play back at the same speed, keeping them in sync with each other\n\n\u2022 Fiddle with the speed control even while you're playing notes: Slow, stop or even rewind the sound in the middle of notes \u2014 without changing the pitch\n\n\u2022 Granular synthesis allows you to create instruments or  effects from a recording, that do not sound like the original, yet retain its realistic, natural sound\n\n\u2022 FX units: Frequency modulation, ring modulation, echo/delay, distortion, and a low-pass filter with resonance control\n\nSylo Synthesiser also supports Core MIDI: play music from another device via MIDI.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n\u2022 Use existing audio files as the building-blocks of your instrument: import audio from wave, aiff, mp3 and aac/m4a files\n\n\u2022 Save recordings to your iPad or to Dropbox* online storage\n\n\u2022 Save your new instruments to the preset list for quick access\n\n\u2022\u00a0Exchange audio with other apps via AudioCopy/AudioPaste or \"Open in...\" (where supported)\n\nPlease note: The microphone button in Sylo Synthesiser is for recording sound into the synth, to use as the basis for new instruments \u2014 not for making a permanent record of what you play! (We've heard from a couple of people confused about this so we thought we'd make it clear!) If you wish to record your performances, you can use the Record button in the toolbar for this purpose.\n\n\n(* Dropbox account required for these features.
