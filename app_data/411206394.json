(over 50% off!)\n\nABOUT SCAN\n\nScan is the fastest and most user-friendly QR reader and barcode scanner available. If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod came with a built-in scanner, this would be it. Here is what our reviewers are saying:\n\n\u201cQuick and very reliable. I\u2019d give it six stars if it were possible.\u201d\n\u201cNo ads, beautiful design, and even caught blurry QR codes I didn\u2019t expect it to scan\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve saved over $80 by scanning products in the store and finding them cheaper online\u201d\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nTo scan a QR code or barcode simply open the app, point the camera at the code, and you\u2019re done! There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at.\n\nWhen scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action.\n\nPRODUCT BARCODES\n\nScan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan. Barcode scanning requires a newer iPhone or iPad in order to work reliably. Cameras on older devices do not provide the resolution or focus required for barcode scanning.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\n\u2022 View a history list and map of all of your past scans\n\u2022 Sync your scan history across the web and all of your devices\n\u2022 Toggle your front or rear camera for scanning\n\u2022 Set a default browser to open websites in\n\u2022 Scan pictures of QR codes and barcodes from your camera roll\n\u2022 A switch to turn on your device\u2019s light (if it has one) for scanning in low-light circumstances\n\nDEDICATED TO PERFECTION\n\nOur goal is to make our app the best scanning app in the store. We can\u2019t do this without you. We are dedicated to your satisfaction and need to hear feedback from you. If you have an issue with Scan, please do not write a review of the app saying \"it didn't work.\" This does not help us make things better for you. Instead, please contact us at support@scan.me or on Twitter @scan and we'll do our best to help.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIn order to use Scan, your device must have a built-in camera. When scanning codes that redirect to online content, such as websites, you will need Internet connectivity.\n\nMAKE YOUR OWN QR CODES ON SCAN.ME\n\nWant to make your own QR codes for others to scan?
