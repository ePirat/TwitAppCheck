(Because you demanded it!) You can now bookmark without being logged in. If you do log in, we'll go ahead and store them for you so that you can view them on your other devices (and to keep them safe). Being logged in will also give you other options (like bookmark sorting and the ability to leave quicktips). It's pretty quick and painless, but .. hey, we thought we'd give you the choice.\n\nWe also cleaned up the activity feed (it was kind of messy) and updated it so that you can see the activity for whatever city you have selected. Want to see what they are doing in other places?   Go for it.\n\nSpeaking of cities, there's a new \"Suggest a City...\" link on the city selection screen. If your city isn't there, let us know. Who knows?  It may be next.\n\nAnd last but not least, we fixed some random bugs that had been bothering us, because that's what we do.", "sellerUrl": "http://bestof.voiceplaces.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/6b/0a/e8/6b0ae833-ca0a-3137-2a45-6a618694edf5/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/1c/c9/cd/1cc9cddd-4977-45b6-f405-c63d163ba36a/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/1c/e6/e0/1ce6e0a9-d591-fc4c-0716-0ca5947742ba/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/28/1e/32/281e322a-679f-b34b-a0b1-632f0ec583d5/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e7/cf/25/e7cf255b-87c4-a587-5b9b-2fbf4a31e52c/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 493, "trackContentRating": "12+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/voice-media-group/id601602089?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "sellerName": "Voice Media Group, Inc.", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone-3GS", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone4S", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPhone5", "iPadWifi", "iPhone5s", "iPad3G", "iPhone5c", "iPad2Wifi", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPad23G", "iPhone4", "iPadMini4G", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadMini"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1159.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/79/ae/b4/79aeb4d9-a7ea-927e-49e9-61169d27fce5/mzl.mxudqakj.png", "bundleId": "com.villagevoice.bestof", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bestof.../id423026446?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "5.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1306.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/7e/f3/ee/7ef3ee46-152e-ea88-b00c-354b251a8790/BO.VP-app_iconx57v3.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
