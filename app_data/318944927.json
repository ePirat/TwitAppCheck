It achieves superb image quality by stitching full-resolution camera images rather than low-resolution video frames as used in other apps.\n\nOur new StitchGuide* mode makes it easy to capture exactly the scene that you want.  The augmented reality interface elegantly displays the positions where previous images have been taken, making it easy to line up your next photo perfectly.\n\n(*StitchGuide requires an iPhone4/iPad2/iPod5 or newer, and iOS 5.0 or greater)\n\nFeatures:\n\u25cf Simple and intuitive interface.
