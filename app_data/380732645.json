Book your Wheely car via the app or online to collect you at the desired time, and enjoy your ride in style. Priced at 30% less than other taxi or driver service providers, Wheely does not use surge pricing and we quote the journey fare to you prior to the booking, which means that you can get to your destination at reasonable cost whenever you want.\n\nThe Wheely service is cashless since you pay through the app or online with your credit or debit card, and our fleet consists of uniformed unbranded cars (no taxi signs) with professionally trained and well-attired drivers.\n\nWheely is much more than just another taxi service. Our immaculate drivers will open doors for you, help with luggage, provide bottles of water to keep you hydrated on your journey, ask for your music / radio preferences or give you a relaxing and peaceful ride in complete silence.\n\nWheely is available in London, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and other cities. At the end of each journey, the fare will be billed directly to the credit or debit card connected with your Wheely account, followed by a detailed journey receipt sent to your email inbox.\n\nWheely guarantees security and strict confidentiality of your personal details. Wheely does not store your information - it is coded and passed on directly to the bank in full compliance with the PCI-DSS certificate.\n\n\nReviews\n\n\u201cThe service was fast and exceptional, and the car was cool.\u201d\nMashable.com\n\n\u201cIn one of @Wheely's new Mercedes Benz E Class with the  gorgeous singer @LydiaBaylis heading to a Christmas Market\u2026\u201d\n@TheLondonIndex\n\n\u201cThank you @wheely for my lovely taxi to the airport!
