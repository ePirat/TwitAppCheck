You can make anyone come alive, just like the talking wall portraits in Harry Potter\u2019s Hogwarts castle.  \n\n*** How to use the app *** \n- Take a portrait photo or pick one from your photo library, and the face will automatically start moving in 3D. \n- Talk to it and it will repeat your every word. \n- Record your moving 3D avatar as a movie.\n- Download fun hairstyles, glasses, masks, and beards, and apply them to your animated 3D avatar. \n- Share your 3D movie with friends via email, Facebook, and YouTube.  Upload your new look to Twitter and Facebook, and use it as your Twitter profile icon. \n\n** What's New in Version 3.3 ** \n- Simply talk to the image and it will repeat your word. You no longer have to press the Record button. You can change the playback speed as well.\n- Optimized for the retina display\n\n* Tips *\nIf you need to reinstall the app but don't want to lose the image and audio files you created, save them by sending them to yourself via PhotoSpeak Mail.\n\nPhotoSpeak Fan Page on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/PhotoSpeak/110338349000504\nTwitter: @motionportrait\n\nPhotoSpeak is powered by MotionPortrait technology.\nSee more at http://www.motionportrait.com/e/", "artistName": "MotionPortrait, Inc.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1539.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/93/75/79/937579ec-0712-ec3d-f5ea-f42fd591a969/mzl.atljxmch.png", "version": "3.6.1", "primaryGenreId": 6016, "primaryGenreName": "Entertainment", "fileSizeBytes": "9856589", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "PhotoSpeak: 3D Talking Photo", "genreIds": ["6016", "6008"], "trackName": "PhotoSpeak: 3D Talking Photo", "releaseNotes": "Show error messages if it fails to save images/videos\nUpdate \"MP Apps\"", "sellerUrl": "http://www.motionportrait.com/en/apps/photospeak/", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ef/6a/fd/ef6afdfe-b219-f767-6b66-afc0d72d6c80/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d4/37/f9/d437f968-34a7-7a90-4cdd-3b0137ca2a89/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/ae/cd/07/aecd07a3-b72e-f86f-d346-cef1678b9b44/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/fc/dd/08/fcdd0803-c352-fe7e-d9b8-bf2dfd380d90/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/e4/09/c1e409b8-262b-1dbb-fc3a-a5e3bf404b27/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 698, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/motionportrait-inc./id319913225?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "sellerName": "MotionPortrait, Inc.", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone5s", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadMini", "iPadMini4G", "iPad23G", "iPhone4S", "iPhone-3GS", "iPad2Wifi", "iPhone4", "iPadThirdGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone5", "iPhone5c", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPadThirdGen4G"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1539.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/93/75/79/937579ec-0712-ec3d-f5ea-f42fd591a969/mzl.atljxmch.png", "bundleId": "com.motionportrait.PhotoSpeak", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photospeak-3d-talking-photo/id329711426?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "6.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1337.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/75/45/48/75454883-326b-cc71-2585-4808f034ea8d/Icon.png", "averageUserRating": 3.0}
