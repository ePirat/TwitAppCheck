Players do more than just build a city; rather, they erect a veritable Las Vegas prototype. This means that the city comes really alive at night, as that's the \"hottest\" time in real-world Vegas: casinos erupt in bright lights, cars flood the roads, and life is humming. Build Vegas the way you want it: use unique bars, entertainment centers and (naturally!) casinos to create an atmosphere of total, uninhibited fun! Then try your own luck at a jackpot! Visit your friends, vote for the best city, help one another and send each other gifts. Challenge your friends with achievements - be the best in Rock the Vegas!\u00a0\n\nGame Objectives:\n- build your own Las Vegas in the middle of the desert;\u00a0\n- upgrade your buildings and receive a profit;\u00a0\n- build casinos to attract more tourists;\u00a0\n- try your own luck and win a jackpot;\u00a0\n- expand your territory;\u00a0\n- visit your friends, vote for their cities and send gifts to each other;\u00a0\n- compete with your friends for the best ratings;\u00a0\n\nGame Features:\u00a0\n- Build your very own Las Vegas\n- An atmosphere of total, uninhibited fun\n- Unique bars, entertainment centers and (naturally!) casinos\u00a0\n- Switch between day and night modes and play in the glamorous neon light\n- Try your hand at gambling and winning a jackpot\u00a0\n- Visit your friends, help them and send gifts to each other\u00a0\n- Challenge your friends - be the best in Rock the Vegas!\u00a0\n\n**************************** \niPad version: http://bit.ly/ipad_ivegas\n\nLike Rock The Vegas on Facebook! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/VegasiPhone\n\nTrailer:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt-euZmr7HE\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.game-insight.com/legal/privacy/", "artistName": "Game Insight, LLC", "artworkUrl512": "http://a888.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/77/3a/ca/773acad4-6232-9bf1-e236-563ffc291c90/mzl.xemkkxok.png", "version": "1.2.1", "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "54625790", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": true, "trackCensoredName": "Rock The Vegas for iPhone", "genreIds": ["6014", "7015", "7009"], "trackName": "Rock The Vegas for iPhone", "releaseNotes": "Game stability improvements", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c0/52/a6/c052a69a-2b8c-92a2-9a95-26b30321d040/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c5/f3/34/c5f334d9-02ae-9fee-9ece-5a4c8717405e/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/d6/a7/65/d6a76551-7a46-8420-4685-b10c4594d5fe/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/f2/0b/12/f20b12b4-3cf0-dd96-40d6-7dd025490fbf/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/9f/23/7d/9f237d1f-c2fa-6aed-5996-5f07bf5d9ab2/screen320x320.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 3386, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/game-insight-llc/id396958698?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.5, "sellerName": "Game Insight LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPad2Wifi", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPad23G", "iPhone-3GS", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone4S", "iPadFourthGen", "iPadThirdGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5", "iPhone4", "iPad3G", "iPadWifi", "iPhone5c", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPhone5s", "iPadMini", "iPadMini4G"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a888.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/77/3a/ca/773acad4-6232-9bf1-e236-563ffc291c90/mzl.xemkkxok.png", "bundleId": "com.gameinsight.rockthevegasiphone", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rock-the-vegas-for-iphone/id484905687?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1022.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/25/0e/de/250ede9c-5ef6-cf5f-92d6-92b5ed23071b/appicon.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
