Feel awkward asking for a return email receipt from clients, colleagues, friends or family?  Well, the Email Detective is now on the case!\n\nSimply type the email subject and your return address and hit Send\u2026.. the Email Detective will magically launch your email app where you can complete your message as usual.  As soon as your message is received and opened the Email Detective will report back that your email was not only received and opened, but when.  No one but you and the Email Detective will ever know.\n\nUnlike other return receipt solutions, the Email Detective is automatic and will generate a return receipt immediately.  It couldn\u2019t be simpler.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nHow do I use Email Detective?\nCouldn't be easier.  Simply open Email Detective, tap Compose Email, enter a subject and your return email where you'd like to receive the receipt.\n\nHow does it work?\nIt isn't rocket science (though we think it's clever). Email Detective inserts a tiny 4 pixel image into your outgoing email. When the email is opened, the image being shown triggers the return email to the selected address you entered.\n\nWill it work 100% of the time?\nNope. Some folks disable their email client's option to download images for security reason. Email Detective is harmless, but there is no way for the recipient's email app to know the difference.  We will continue to work on options to bring up the percentage of returned receipts.\n\nWho do I contact if I need help?\nUs.  Shoot us an email at support@outtoplay.com, include as much detail as you can, and we'll get back to you, usually, within a few hours. (Monday thru Friday).\n\n\nFor the latest news and updates, follow us on Twitter @EmailDetective\n\n***************************\nNote to those of you who are downloading and testing the Email Detective for the first time: It is impossible for you to trigger your own read receipt. \n\nTo assist Email Detective efficiently identify emails opened to your friends, family and colleagues, be sure the recipient is not on your home or local network.", "artistName": "Out to Play Entertainment Inc.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a663.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/da/69/ac/mzl.cqhvczeu.jpg", "version": "1.1", "primaryGenreId": 6002, "primaryGenreName": "Utilities", "fileSizeBytes": "14544240", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Email Detective", "genreIds": ["6002", "6000"], "trackName": "Email Detective", "releaseNotes": "The two most requested features have been added to Email Detective.\n\n1.
