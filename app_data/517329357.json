You can also explore the most beautiful weather animation you\u2019ve ever seen, both forward in time or back. \n\n(Dark Sky is available in the US, UK and Ireland.)\n\nYOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE \nUsing GPS, Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-to-minute predictions for the next hour and detailed forecasts for the next day and week.\n\nBEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS \nThe same technology that powers Dark Sky\u2019s predictions also allows us to make the world\u2019s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky\u2019s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it\u2019s going in the future. \n\nPUSH NOTIFICATIONS \nDark Sky can send you an alert before it starts raining at your exact location. Even if you haven't opened the app in days, Dark Sky will know when you're in the path of a storm. \n\nTODAY WIDGET\nThe Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what's going to happen in the next hour, so you don't even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.", "artistName": "Jackadam", "artworkUrl512": "http://a829.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/4d/04/aa/4d04aaef-7563-13a4-bb1e-202c4ed7dd98/mzl.ekzkdkwt.png", "version": "4.2.2", "primaryGenreId": 6001, "primaryGenreName": "Weather", "fileSizeBytes": "6522639", "price": 3.99, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Dark Sky - Weather Radar, Hyperlocal Forecasts, and Storm Alerts", "genreIds": ["6001", "6002"], "trackName": "Dark Sky - Weather Radar, Hyperlocal Forecasts, and Storm Alerts", "releaseNotes": "- Bug fixes\n- Some improvements to VoiceOver support.
