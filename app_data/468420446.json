Set your pickup location, select a car of your choice, tap Hailo Now and that\u2019s it!  Available in London, Manchester and Ireland. \n\nTrack your car in real time as it comes to pick you up in minutes. Or just kick back and relax, we\u2019ll notify you when your car has arrived.  Payments are simple and happen right from the app so you can just hop out when you arrive at your destination. And safety is a top Hailo priority -- all of our drivers are licensed by the local authority.\n\nGet started with \u00a310 or \u20ac10 off your first ride, choose the right promo code for your city: \nAPPLDN | APPMNC | APPIRE\n\n================================================================\nWhy choose Hailo?\n\nSetting your pickup location is a breeze: \nWe integrate with Foursquare and we remember your frequently used locations.\n\nCar choices:\nWhether in a classic taxi or a luxury car, it\u2019s easy to choose how you want to roll. \n\nFare Quotes: \nNever again agree to pay for a fare without knowing about how much it will cost. Use our fare quotes feature to  enter your a destination, and we\u2019ll give you an estimate of how much your fare will cost.\n\nAn easy way to pay:\nNo more fussing with paying for your taxi. Enter your card in our app and we\u2019ll safely and securely keep it stored. Add multiple cards if you want, and you can switch between them for any trip.  For those that must, don\u2019t worry as you can still pay with cash.\n\nTrip History and Receipts:\nHandy dandy receipts are kept in your history, and we\u2019ll also email you a copy at the end of your trip.\n\nRecover lost items: \nOne day we left our wallet in the back of a taxi and it made for a pretty bad day. So we thought it would be great if Hailo offered a way to help you recover lost property. \n\nAccessibility: \nNeed a wheelchair accessible taxi? No problem, flip the accessibility switch on and we\u2019ll only send accessible vehicles.\n\nTwitter & Facebook integration: \nThis is major because if you don\u2019t tweet or post about your journey, how do people know it actually happened? Did it actually happen?", "artistName": "Hailo Network Ltd.", "artworkUrl512": "http://a80.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/0d/ee/e0/0deee0fc-39a9-f626-f3bd-c73e5737a0cd/mzl.asqxwmjh.png", "version": "4.1", "primaryGenreId": 6003, "primaryGenreName": "Travel", "fileSizeBytes": "8972399", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Hailo", "genreIds": ["6003", "6010"], "trackName": "Hailo", "releaseNotes": "By now you many of you have seen our new swag: a whole new passenger app re-designed for lovers of a clean UI.
