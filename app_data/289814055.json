It allows you to bookmark frequently used stops, displays recently accessed stops, and gives details for arrivals which are en-route.\n\nYou can enter the stop \"id\" of the stop (as displayed at each stop or station) or you can browse the routes for the stop.\n\nFeature includes:\n- Interactive rail maps, showing the MAX, WES and Streetcar stops.\n- Embedded maps, showing locations of stops, and when available, the last known position of the bus or train.\n- Use GPS to locate nearby stops or rail stations.\n- Browse routes and stops, show an entire route on the map.\n- Links to TriMet route information.\n- Displays Rider Alerts, and Detours.\n- A \"Nighttime visibility flasher\" - a flashing screen that can be used at night so that drivers can see you.  TriMet suggests holding up a cell phone to make yourself visible to bus drivers.\n-Trip Planning - now you can use the same trip planning feature that is available on TriMet's web site.\n- Specially formatted text to work with the iPhone 3GS VoiceOver accessibility feature to speak arrivals.\n- QR code reader to read codes at bus stops and stations\n\nRoute and arrival data provided by permission of TriMet.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote: this free application was developed as a volunteer effort to provide a service for TriMet riders, the developer has no affiliation with TriMet, or Apple.
