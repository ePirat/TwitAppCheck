Grow your stable with many horses and train them to become Derby Champions.  Breed your champion race horses to create 'super baby' horses that become even faster!  Derby Quest is an amazing horse care-taking and racing simulation game.  It's a game full of strategy and arcade action.\n\n*** SPECIAL WARNING***:  Due to the powerful 3D graphics in this game, Derby Quest will not run on any devices older than the iPhone 3GS or 4th Generation iPod Touch.\n\nBREED!\n\nBreed new horses and turn them into champions.  Breed your horses and create multi-generations of offspring.  You can eventually have HUNDREDS of horses in your stable.\n\nFEED!\n\nYou'll need to take good care of your horses.  Feed them when they are hungry and be sure to figure out what special treats each horse likes -- it will help with their race performance.\n\nTRAIN!\n\nImprove each horse's track performance through a series of training mini-games.  You'll be able to improve how fast your horse gets out of the starting box, how well your horse can lead the pack,  improve your horse's endurance and acceleration ability, and much much more!\n\nRACE!\n\nYou'll take each of your horses through a series of qualifying race classes.  Once your horse has won all of the necessary qualifying races, it's onto the Derby Class!  The Derby Class is where you'll race much greater competition but have a chance to prove that your horse is a champion.  And if you win enough Derby Class races you'll qualify for the exclusive \"Derby Quest Cup\" -- it's the single most important championship in the game!  (Good luck!)\n\nDuring a race you are in full control of your horse -- move to the rail or stay on the outside, pull-up to slow your pace or to go around another horse, and make your jockey get out his whip when you think it's the right time to make a move!\n\nYou'll get a lot of enjoyment out of playing this ground-breaking horse racing game and you'll get a chance to race your horses against the world!\n\nDOWNLOAD THIS FREE GAME NOW TO START BUILDING YOUR CHAMPION STABLE!\n\nHow Will YOUR HORSES Rank Against The World?", "artistName": "Best Free and Fun Games, LLC", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1257.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/62/97/55/62975550-a382-7860-206c-021f589b8918/mzl.shyyibsn.png", "version": "2.1.1169", "primaryGenreId": 6014, "primaryGenreName": "Games", "fileSizeBytes": "89027135", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": true, "trackCensoredName": "Derby Quest Horse Racing Game", "genreIds": ["6014", "6016", "7013", "7016"], "trackName": "Derby Quest Horse Racing Game", "releaseNotes": "- Recover legacy data.\n- Disabled multi-touch on selected screens.\n- Tutorials can be skipped.\n- Fixed tutorial dead-ends.\n- Updated play services.\n- Enabled selling of horses.", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d9/6d/4d/d96d4d39-f61d-c609-5d53-7809d32c5c8d/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c0/2c/45/c02c4572-0acf-93c8-6ee9-1f3b4ed77408/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/01/7a/e2/017ae20a-e419-97e0-c581-3f30906771b9/screen320x320.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/59/02/e8/5902e892-e8d8-30f9-9ef6-3feea6cac5bb/screen320x320.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 6108, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/best-free-and-fun-games-llc/id499344659?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 4.0, "sellerName": "Best Free and Fun Games, LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPhone-3GS", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadThirdGen", "iPhone4", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5", "iPadMini4G", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone5c", "iPhone5s", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadMini", "iPhone4S"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1257.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/62/97/55/62975550-a382-7860-206c-021f589b8918/mzl.shyyibsn.png", "bundleId": "com.tapsy.derbystar2011", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/derby-quest-horse-racing-game/id480528407?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "6.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1162.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/5b/86/97/5b869766-19ec-25b0-5193-fb18622300a9/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
