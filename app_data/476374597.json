He's obnoxious...  and he could likely use a breath mint...  but that won't stop him from blurting out whatever he's thinking!\n\nChoose from over 100 pre-recorded sayings in categories like sarcasm, taunts, yelling, laughter, painful (our favorite), drunk, flirty, attitude and more.\n\nOr, record and save your own voice to create that perfect situational audio clip.  Let Loud Mouth yell your voice clip with character by altering the speed and pitch for even better comedic performance!\n\nWhatever your choice, Loud Mouth will yell it for all to hear by simply tapping his mouth.  Open the included library to browse audio clips and your own saved recordings.\n\nBeware of flying digital slobber.  Loud Mouth tends to \"spray it\" not \"say it\".\n\n\u2605 IMPORTANT \u2605\nA 3GS or later device is recommended for best performance!", "artistName": "Fossil Software", "artworkUrl512": "http://a50.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ae/14/63/ae14636c-4355-d2fb-868e-dea106d4c22b/mzm.zyyvqxjy.png", "version": "1.7", "primaryGenreId": 6016, "primaryGenreName": "Entertainment", "fileSizeBytes": "15418914", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "Loud Mouth", "genreIds": ["6016", "6012"], "trackName": "Loud Mouth", "releaseNotes": "iOS 6 Compatibility Update", "sellerUrl": "http://www.fossilsoftware.com", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/0f/7b/06/0f7b06aa-5f68-276a-d0af-93afe8596ac3/screen320x480.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/89/24/09/892409cf-543a-8e62-b0f5-1c6fb1213006/screen320x480.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/76/7e/be/767ebe20-b68c-772a-7fbe-78aa4bee69e6/screen320x480.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2b/01/7f/2b017f62-b0ee-ddde-9535-d7dc49662ab4/screen320x480.jpeg", "http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/93/e1/75/93e175ba-243f-6e62-ddbd-e5eebee9be09/screen320x480.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 1098, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/fossil-software/id338022202?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 3.5, "sellerName": "Fossil Software LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPadMini", "iPodTouchourthGen", "iPadFourthGen4G", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPhone4S", "iPadThirdGen", "iPad23G", "iPhone-3GS", "iPadWifi", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad3G", "iPhone5c", "iPhone5", "iPad2Wifi", "iPodTouchThirdGen", "iPadMini4G", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPhone5s", "iPhone4"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a50.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/ae/14/63/ae14636c-4355-d2fb-868e-dea106d4c22b/mzm.zyyvqxjy.png", "bundleId": "com.fossilsoftware.loudmouth", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loud-mouth/id476374597?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "4.3", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1594.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/03/42/f1/0342f16c-a407-151e-3eed-b79ca76db179/Icon.png", "averageUserRating": 4.0}
