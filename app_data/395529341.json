You meant to get them all done but you forgot to check it in time.  Maybe, instead of a to-do list, you need RE.minder!\n\nTo-Do lists are great, and they can be useful to get organized.  But sometimes, it\u2019s not about organization. Sometimes, it\u2019s about getting something done ON TIME.  For that, we give you RE.minder, completely re-engineered to be faster, easier and even more useful.\n\n** Set a RE.minder with as few as 3 taps and the magic of iOS\u2019s local notifications will make sure you get the nudge you need, right when you need it.  Even Offline! **\n\n\nRE.minder features:\n\n* Action Bar *\n\n\u2022 Delay - 1 tap to reset or delay a RE.minder, without ever leaving the list!\n\u2022 Bug Me - set a RE.minder to bug you every minute or every hour until you shut it off.  \n\u2022 Share a RE.minder via email. One tap, and they\u2019ve set the RE.minder on their iOS device.\n\n\n* Better notes and better history! *\n\n\u2022 You asked us for better notes, and we listened.  Longer notes entry area and longer viewable notes in the RE.minder list! Go ahead and write a novel in there if you like! (Don\u2019t write a novel)\n\u2022 You can still reset a RE.minder with just two taps in the history tab but we\u2019ve made it smarter.  Reset a RE.minder for the same time or the same interval, or pick a new time.\n\n\n* What else? *\n\n\u2022 RE.minder now remembers what you enter for any Quick Picker making it even faster to set new RE.minders\n\u2022 Over 20 Quick Pickers for categories and intervals.\n\u2022 Over 20 different sounds in 3 categories: Simple, Fun or Musical.  \n\u2022 Accessibility - RE.minder has full VoiceOver support.\n\u2022 Now choose from English, German, Spanish or Italian with even more coming soon.\n\n\n\n** RE.minder PRO **\n(Available via In App Purchase)\n\n\u2022 Quiet Time-\n- Pull down on RE.minder list to set \"Quiet Time\" \n\n\u2022 Advanced repeating support-\n- Days of the week, specific repetions, end dates and more!\n\n\u2022 Customize your experience\n- Color schemes, colored icons, random sounds!\n\n\u2022 Advanced Workflow \n- RE.minder PRO lets you jump right into advanced options while you\u2019re setting it.\n\n\n** Add-On Packs **\n\u2022 Add 20 new musical sounds\n\u2022 Add 22 new fun sounds\n\u2022 Get some extra volume from 17 extra loud sounds\n\u2022 Fun and Games Icon Pack (media, sports and transportation)\n\u2022 Home and Office Icon Pack (medical, food and drink, office and social)\n\u2022 Miscellaneous Icon Pack\n\n\nIf you want all of the above for one low price, check out RE.minder PRO+ and save a few dollars!\n\n\nSo when you\u2019re ready to turn those To-Didn\u2019ts into Dones, download RE.minder for free!", "artistName": "Handelabra Studio LLC", "artworkUrl512": "http://a1281.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/f6/1f/e9/f61fe9c8-ba43-a37e-d62f-72ea41f4ef33/mzl.nxeijorz.png", "version": "2.1.9", "primaryGenreId": 6007, "primaryGenreName": "Productivity", "fileSizeBytes": "21784525", "price": 0.0, "isGameCenterEnabled": false, "trackCensoredName": "RE.minder", "genreIds": ["6007", "6002"], "trackName": "RE.minder", "releaseNotes": "\u2022 This update includes iOS 8 support and many bug fixes.\n\nJapanese translation provided by MayumiH.com.", "sellerUrl": "http://postmechanical.com/re-minder/", "screenshotUrls": ["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/0e/ee/a7/0eeea711-4cdb-e2c7-6a1c-fea572963889/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/d1/0e/59/d10e59f1-14c4-efb8-e90a-8137feed26ec/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/d2/c7/32/d2c7326e-10c5-1013-1518-724041f7b446/screen1136x1136.jpeg", "http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/44/cd/81/44cd81b0-f34c-84ba-d988-0635f914dac8/screen1136x1136.jpeg"], "userRatingCount": 1482, "trackContentRating": "4+", "formattedPrice": "Free", "artistViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/handelabra-studio-llc/id371135968?uo=4", "kind": "software", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion": 5.0, "sellerName": "Handelabra Studio LLC", "supportedDevices": ["iPadFourthGen4G", "iPhone4", "iPhone5s", "iPadThirdGen4G", "iPadFourthGen", "iPad23G", "iPadMini4G", "iPhone5c", "iPhone4S", "iPodTouchFifthGen", "iPad2Wifi", "iPadThirdGen", "iPhone5", "iPadMini"], "artworkUrl100": "http://a1281.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/f6/1f/e9/f61fe9c8-ba43-a37e-d62f-72ea41f4ef33/mzl.nxeijorz.png", "bundleId": "com.handelabra.REminder", "trackViewUrl": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/re.minder/id395529341?mt=8&uo=4", "minimumOsVersion": "7.0", "artworkUrl60": "http://a1637.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/c9/b8/0c/c9b80cba-5929-99ff-6274-556570e2bf98/AppIcon57x57.png", "averageUserRating": 4.5}
